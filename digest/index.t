<p> BAGDER is the editor of the Rockbox digest section. He tries to keep up
 with discussions on IRC, the mailing list, the sourceforge trackers and CVS
 commits to sum up what's going on in the project in a slightly digested
 manner. Suitable for outsiders who don't care to follow the intense
 development mailing list and similar.

<p> You can also access the digest as a <a href="digest.rss">RSS feed</a>.

<p> You should be able to get a Rockbox sidebar in your Netscape/Mozilla
browser using <a href="http://sidenews.net/">sidenews.net</a>.

<p> The work on this was started on April 15th, 2003. On the day of the
 Rockbox 2.0 release. If you found something you think are wrong, anything
 I've missed in here or similar, drop me a mail at <a

 se</a>. If you have ideas or opinions about the actual subjects mentioned, <a
 href="/mail/">join the mailing list</a> and post about it there.
