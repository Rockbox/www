<p>There are several ways to disassemble the Archos Jukeboxes.
Here is an approach where you don't need to bend any metal parts.

First, remove the battery covers and unscrew all 8 visible screws: 2 torx screws on the left and right sides, and 2 small philips head screws on the top and bottom. Then you simply lift off the plastic top cover.
