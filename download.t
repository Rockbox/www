</ul>

<h3>player</h3>
<p>This version is for Archos Jukebox 6000 with ROM firmware 4.50 or later, and all Studio models.

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>recorder</h3>
<p>Version 1.0 does not support the Recorder. Future versions will.


<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Unzip the archive. Rename your current archos.mod (if any) in the root of your archos, then copy the rockbox archos.mod there.

<p>To remove the Rockbox firmware, just reverse the process: Rename the rockbox archos.mod file and replace it with your original firmware file. If you had no firmware file, just renaming or removing the rockbox file is sufficient.

<p>(Note that some models cannot shut off while the power adapter is plugged in.)
