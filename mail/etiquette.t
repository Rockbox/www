   Violating these guidelines will make people ignore your posts and

   <h2>1. Subscription requirements. </h2>
      Recently, we have had to impose a restriction on the mailing
      lists.  You must be subscribed to the mailing list in order to
      post messages to that mailing list. This is mainly due to the
      massive amounts of spam we need to deal with somehow otherwise.

   <h2>2. Sending a new message to the list.</h2>
      DO NOT reply to an existing message as a short-cut to post a
      message to the lists. Email is not a disjunct set of messages, but
      is threaded, and mailing lists use this feature to provide a
      coherent archive. Many email clients also group messages into a
      thread. When ever you hit the "Reply" button, it adds information
      to your outgoing email that tells the rest of the world that it is
      a reply to that message.

   <h2>3. Replying to a message from the list.</h2>
      When you do reply to a message someone else has posted, please use
      the "Group reply" or "Reply to all" button on your mailer.
      Individual developers don't know everything, and by replying to
      them personally, you effectively cut yourself off from all the
      other people who could help you. Please ensure that you reply to
      the list.
<p>
      If you are including the original message in your reply, always
      edit the message such that it only quotes the sections which are
      relevant to your reply. Don't just quote the whole of the message
      to which you're replying.
<p>
      Also, please use a mail client which correctly includes
      References: and/or In-Reply-To: headers in email replies. These
      headers are what keeps threads together by indicating precisely
      which messages you are replying to, and the absence of them
      obfuscates the mailing list by making your reply appear to start a
      new thread of its own rather than being correctly associated with
      the message to which you replied. Some mail clients, in particular
      some configurations of Microsoft Outlook, are not
      standards-compliant and do not conform to the recommendations of
      <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</a>. In the case of Outlook you may be able to work around
      the bug by switching to its 'Internet Email' mode.
<p>
      If you reply to a message, don't use top-posting. Top-posting is
      when you write the new text at the top of a mail and you insert
      the previous quoted mail conversation below.
<p>
      This is why top posting is so bad:
<pre>
        A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read
           text.
        Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
        A: Top-posting.
        Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?
</pre>
      All this is pretty straight forward, and can be found in
      <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1855.html">RFC1855</a> - Netiquette Guidelines.

   <h2>4. Sensible subjects.</h2>
      By phrasing a correct and descriptive subject of your mail, you
      increase the chances of it being read by persons who you address.
      This is particularly important for the people who subscribe to a
      mailing list in digest mode since then the subject of the mail a
      user replies to is by default always unsuitable for sending.
      
   <h2>5. Searching the archives, the web and the wiki</h2>
      Please search the mailing list archives before posting a technical
      question or a problem to the mailing lists. It is highly possible
      that your question has already been asked before, or someone else
      has encountered your problem and a solution has already been aired
      on the lists.

   <h2>6. Automatic replies.</h2>
      We don't need to know that you're out of office. If you enable an
      autoresponder, do it in such a way that it doesn't respond to
      mailing list messages. Failure to do so will get you unsubscribed
      from the list.

   <h2>7. Unsubscribing.</h2>
      You NEVER ever mail to the list asking to get unsubscribed. You use
      the <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/mail/">same page</a> to unsubscribe that you used to subscribe. As bonus
      feature, every single mail sent out from the mailing list contains
      unsubscribe information in the mail headers.

   <h2>8. Credits and further reading.</h2>
      Parts of these etiquette guidelines come from Russell King's guide
      from the linux-arm-kernel mailing list.
