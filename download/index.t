<h2>No current release available</h2>

<p>
 There is no "current" release, get a <a href="http://build.rockbox.org/">current build</a> instead.

<p>
 The last time we did a formal release was very long ago and for <b>Archos only</b>. It was version 2.5 and can be found in the <a href="http://download.rockbox.org/old_releases/">old releases</a> archive.
