<h2>Submitting new bug reports</h2>

<a name="rules"></a>
<h3>Rules for bug reporting:</h3>

<ol>
<li> Do not report bugs for unreleased code (i.e. Iriver at the moment). Use the <a href="/mail/">mailing list</a> or <a href="/irc/">IRC</a> to discuss such development.
<li> Check that the bug hasn't already been fixed! Try the latest <a href="/daily.shtml">daily build</a>.
<li> Check that the bug hasn't already been reported
<li> Do not add "I have the same problem" to an existing bug report if you aren't <b>absolutely certain</b> that it really is the same problem
<li> Always include the following information in your bug report:
  <ul>
  <li> Which exact music player model you have (as printed on the unit)
  <li> Which exact Rockbox version you are using (Menu->Version)
  <li> A link to the data that malfunctions, if applicable (IMPORTANT!)
  </ul>
<li>If you have a Sourceforge account, log in before you file the report.
<li>If you don't have a SF account, sign the report with your email.
</ol>

<p><b>Don't file "bug reports" that really are support questions!</b> Ask on <a href="/mail/">the mailing list</a> or in <a href="/irc/">IRC</a> instead.
