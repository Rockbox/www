<h2>Submitting a new feature request</h2>

<h3>Rules for feature requests:</h3>

<ol>
<li> Check that the feature hasn't already been requested. Duplicates are <b>really</b> boring!
<li> Check that the feature hasn't already been implemented. Download the latest daily build and/or search the mail list archive.
<li>You <b>must</b> be logged in with your Sourceforge account to submit a request. If you don't have an account, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">get one</a>.
</ol>
