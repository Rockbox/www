 This is an April Fools joke.

<p>
 We are proud to present: <big><b>Doom</b> on the Archos</big>!
<p>
 The open-source version of Doom, from ID Software, has been adjusted and
 handicrafted to work on the Recorder models of the Archos MP3 players. Doom
 works on both the ordinary Recorder as well as the FM Recorder version
 (although admittedly a bit slow at times).

 The source code has not yet been committed to CVS, so if you're eager to
 study the source code, then download the package <a

<h2>Screenshots</h2>
<p>
 We only have a few crude screenshots so far. Feel free to provide better ones
 with Doom running on your unit!
