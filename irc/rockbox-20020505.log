<--	[TDM]Mr_B has quit ()
<adiamas>	hmmm
<miah>	hrm?
<adiamas>	nothing.. just makeing updates to the uisim...
<adiamas>	tetris now plays a bit nice with ppl...
<adiamas>	and the menuing of the sim works properly./
<miah>	nice
<--	edx|sleeping has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
<miah>	i've been following the project for a couple months now.. looks like things are getting there
<miah>	i can't wait
<adiamas>	are you on a win machine or a *nix?
<miah>	unix
<miah>	and windows
<adiamas>	then you should pull down the sorce and play with the sim a bit :)
<miah>	my unix boxes all lack X
<adiamas>	ahhh.. 
<miah>	yea, i havnt had much time to play with stuff lately
<adiamas>	that could be a prob...
<miah>	im working on a linux distro
<adiamas>	nice... what pulled you into that?
<miah>	well, i worked at turbolinux for a while
<miah>	and then at penguin computing..
<miah>	doing security / sys admin stuff.. been doing alot of sysadmin / security stuff basically
<PsycoXul>	ok the cursor for the menu's
<miah>	and got sick of installing and then configuring things to the way i liked them
<PsycoXul>	it gets put back on tetris when i go to browse or rockabox
<PsycoXul>	but its still actualy on browse or rockabox
<miah>	so i started building my own stuff, so it would save me time..
<PsycoXul>	and neither of them are doing anything for me
<PsycoXul>	heh
<miah>	but i've been working on it for about a year now
<adiamas>	hmm... let me look
<adiamas>	hehe i know what it is.. one sec
-->	calpefrosch (calpefrosc@p5082C7A8.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #rockbox
---	calpefrosch is now known as calpefrosch|away
<adiamas>	okay.. which makes more sense...
<adiamas>	you choose a menu..
<adiamas>	enter it
<adiamas>	when you come back out
<adiamas>	should the cursor be at the top again, or where you left off?
<adiamas>	im mixed on it
<PsycoXul>	i say where you left off
<miah>	where you left off..
<adiamas>	cool.
<PsycoXul>	and whichever it is, it should be consistent
<adiamas>	well.. i sense a series of funcitons coming for menuing
<PsycoXul>	the current firmware for the player does both in various places of the menu and its annoying heh
<adiamas>	okay.. fixed
<adiamas>	pull it down and try it
<PsycoXul>	actualy its really screwy cause sometimes it goes to the top, sometimes it goes to where it was, and sometimes it goes to a different place in the menu 1 level up... heh [the archos player firmware, that is]
*	adiamas nods
<adiamas>	im going to be thinking about it over the weekend.. it irks me too
*	adiamas takes a bit to switch gears from c++ mode to c mode
<adiamas>	i miss classes _so_ much in a case like this :)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	ok so yeah thats better
*	adiamas nods
<adiamas>	now i just want to slow down tetris,
<adiamas>	fix scoring
<PsycoXul>	browse and rockabox still don't do anything, and if you press left after pressing right on rockabox the items all go blank and you're left with just a cursor
<adiamas>	well.. the browse
<adiamas>	you need to add a 'archos' directory to your files
<adiamas>	that is being used to represent the '/' on the player
<PsycoXul>	where?
<PsycoXul>	ah got it
<PsycoXul>	nice
<adiamas>	in the x11 dir or win dir you are using
<adiamas>	now.. lets see if i can replicate your other issue
<adiamas>	yeah.. roxabox is more of a place holder...
<adiamas>	just something for the screen.. ill remove it.
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	so how much of this works target?
<adiamas>	come again?
<PsycoXul>	er
<PsycoXul>	how much of this works on target?
<PsycoXul>	you know actualy runs on the units
<adiamas>	hmm i can't replicate your blanking when you go left after going right.
<adiamas>	none yet
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	none?
<adiamas>	the simulator just lets us higher level coders start using the api we are developing
<PsycoXul>	the lcd/button stuff should work no?
<adiamas>	well.. some barebones stuff has been worked on..
<adiamas>	but no apps and such...
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	tetris and the screensaver should be able to run on it i would think
<adiamas>	im not about to toss this stuff onto my unit yet ;)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<adiamas>	okay.. newest version up.. try it now
<adiamas>	PsycoXul are you working on windows or lin?
<PsycoXul>	linux
<adiamas>	k...
<adiamas>	im waiting on one of the windows guys.. make sure this stuff works for them...
<adiamas>	i dont think they would have a prob.. but you never know
<PsycoXul>	so what i was really asking is how much of the api's used in the sim's little app/tetris/screensaver/browse are implemented for the target
<adiamas>	everything that runs on/in the sim is using our api... so as far as i know.. most/all
<adiamas>	though... you'd need to confirm that with Zagor and Bagder and edx
<adiamas>	they tend to be involved with more of the on metal stuff
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	ok it looks that the file/directory stuff is still unimplemented 
<adiamas>	thats part of what they are working on :)
-->	Bagder2 (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has joined #rockbox
<adiamas>	hey Bagder2
<Bagder2>	morning
<Bagder2>	:-)
*	Bagder2 tries to figure out why there's a Bagder still present
<adiamas>	there isn't on my list
<Bagder2>	no, but if you /whois bagder, there is one
<adiamas>	hmm.. odd
<adiamas>	PsycoXul wanna do me a favor?
<--	calpefrosch|away has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
<Bagder2>	adiamas: we should rework the menu in app.c to support being longer than can be shown on screen
<Bagder2>	imho
*	adiamas nods
<adiamas>	thats what im working on now ;)
<adiamas>	but i also want to do a 'menu.c/h'
*	Bagder2 bows in front of adiamas
<adiamas>	so makes it easier for sub menus
<Bagder2>	goodie
<Bagder2>	I'll try to attack the dir browser more this weekend
<adiamas>	sweet
<adiamas>	oh.. btw.. off now turns off the sim on the main menu
<Bagder2>	ok, seems reasonable
<adiamas>	i thought so ;)
<adiamas>	anyone mind if i remove the KEY PRESSED: output on stdout?
<Bagder2>	no
<Bagder2>	you can remove the lcd_update() crap too
<adiamas>	k..
<Bagder2>	we'll put it back the day we need to debug those things
<Bagder2>	no need to have them there all the time
<adiamas>	k.. then ill just comment them out
<adiamas>	where in the hell is that beep coming from!
<miah>	
<miah>	=)
<adiamas>	no ..
<adiamas>	ive got that turned off ;)
<adiamas>	i mean from the sim
<Bagder2>	yeah I kinda hate that beep too
<adiamas>	dude.. i don't know who just put in that last feature request, but they are sick :)
*	Bagder2 agrees
<adiamas>	when i do a cvs update
<adiamas>	and i get an 'M' before a file...
<adiamas>	whats that mean?
<Bagder2>	Merge
<Bagder2>	you have local changes
<adiamas>	nods

<Bagder2>	morning Linus
<Linus>	Morning Bagder2
<Bagder2>	Linus / Zagor you plan to go to the Appeal party tonight?
<Zagor>	yep
<Bagder2>	me too
<PsycoXul>	adiamas: what kind of favor?\
<adiamas>	nevermind :)
<PsycoXul>	ok sorry
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Linus>	I am  not going
<calpefrosch>	morning..(#)
<calpefrosch>	for the simulator, which files do I have to create ?
<adiamas>	what do you mean?
<calpefrosch>	I created a \playlists\1.m3u, but I get a strange output
<calpefrosch>	like: filename:     Pý°
<calpefrosch>	load_playlist( £C )
<adiamas>	dunno...
<Bagder2>	what do you do to get that output?
<calpefrosch>	compiled the simulator with VC++ and started it... 
<Bagder2>	oh
<calpefrosch>	Oh, I had to define the DEBUGF for VC++
<calpefrosch>	-> #define DEBUGF debugf in debug.h
<Bagder2>	I don't know why edx has involved the playlist stuff in the simulator at this point
<calpefrosch>	ahh, you mean it is not ready to test...
<Bagder2>	well, there shouldn't be any code calling any playlist functions
<Bagder2>	since the app.c has no code to do that
<calpefrosch>	he is calling the harness.c
<Bagder2>	... and that is badness
<calpefrosch>	hmm
<Bagder2>	the harness.c is the test code for the playlist, it isn't meant to run in a simulator
<calpefrosch>	hehe, now it's working :-)
*	adiamas nods
<adiamas>	okay... i think im done for the evening...
<adiamas>	sleepy time...
<Bagder2>	night adiamas
<adiamas>	and at the request of you europeans.. i am not going 'nappy' ;)
<Bagder2>	haha
<adiamas>	im bedding
<calpefrosch>	good night

<Linus>	typical...
<PsycoXul>	sound?
<Linus>	I have managed to play MP3 data with the MAS!
<PsycoXul>	woo
<Linus>	Kicking!
<Linus>	A historical moment. The first group to have their song played in the Rockbox is Machinae Supremacy.
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Linus>	They shoule be proud
<Zagor>	rather fitting, I'd say :)
<Linus>	or rather 4 seconds of the beginning of the song, but what the heck... :-)
<Zagor>	this is the track, btw: http://www.machinaesupremacy.com/machinae_supremacy_-_arcade.mp3

<Bagder>	Zagor: you tried the ATA/FAT32 on target yet?
<Zagor>	no, not yet. tomorrow...
<Linus>	We have a silly problem with the serial connection to thw MAS.
<Zagor>	more "annoyance" than problem
<Zagor>	yet very annoying :)
<Linus>	The serial interface in the SH1 sends the data LSB first, but the MAS wants it MSB first.
<Linus>	We have to swap bit order of EVERY byte we read from the hard drive!!!
<Linus>	AAAAAAH!
-->	elinenbe (trilluser@bgp01080511bgs.wanarb01.mi.comcast.net) has joined #rockbox

<elinenbe>	congradulations!!!!!!!!!
<elinenbe>	woooo hooo!!!!
<Linus>	You heard!
<elinenbe>	yes!!!
<Linus>	Thx
<elinenbe>	that is awesome!
<Linus>	Indeed!
<Bagder>	so every byte must be reversed bitwise?
<elinenbe>	but why that song? :(  Something like Krudser & Dorfmeister would have been more appropriate :)
<Zagor>	haha
<Linus>	Who are they?
<Linus>	Bagder: Yes, every byte
<Bagder>	nono this should've played:
<Zagor>	we didn't select very conciously, but I think it's rather appropriate actually
<Bagder>	Run level zero - strapped to machinery.mp3
<Bagder>	:-)
<Linus>	or "Living in a Box"
<Bagder>	Linus: time for inlined assembler? B-]
<Bagder>	call Alan!
*	Bagder giggles
<elinenbe>	well, they are DJs from Germany "Kruder & Dorfmeister"
<Zagor>	They make new versions of old C64 songs which they publish on the web. Sort of like we make a new firmware and publish it.
<Linus>	Or "4 sekunder" with Magnus Uggla
<Bagder>	hehe
<PsycoXul>	wait
<PsycoXul>	new versions of old c64 songs?
<PsycoXul>	why would you want to do that? the c64 had such a cool sound
---	Linus is now known as Linus|celebratin
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: listen to their rendition of "giana sisters". they do it justice!
*	Linus|celebratin goes to buy candy
<Zagor>	("do it justice"?) sometimes I don't even understand my own writing...
<Linus|celebratin>	Swenglish
<Zagor>	time for some candy celebration. brb
<elinenbe>	Is everyone here a sugar-holic, or is that just me?
*	Bagder is gonna get a can of coke instead
<miah>	the sidchip rules
<Bagder>	it does
*	Bagder , Linus and Zagor did lots of C64 stuff back in the late 80s
<miah>	i've been encoding all my stuff into ogg lately.. after im done doing that, im probably going to start leeching all the s3m,mod,xm's that i can
<miah>	i already have tons of sids
<miah>	on one of my systems somewhere
<PsycoXul>	yeah ogg
<miah>	oggs are good
<PsycoXul>	there needs to be a way to play ogg on the archos
<PsycoXul>	heh
<miah>	that'd be cool, i'd like to see mod/s3m/xm too
<miah>	that should be easy since those formats require very little cpu power
<Bagder>	well
<Zagor>	we need a DSP guru
<PsycoXul>	it needs realtime mixing
<Bagder>	we only have one chip that plays sound
<miah>	yea
<Zagor>	miah: those formats require multichannel mixing, which we can't do
<miah>	really?
<PsycoXul>	how many channels does the mas support to decode?
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: one mp3 stream
<Bagder>	Zagor: where can I find info about that Splimp thing you have for mp3-playback at home?
<PsycoXul>	yes
<miah>	my stupid laptop keeps going into sleep mode.. so annoying
<PsycoXul>	but mp3 streams can be multi-channel no?
<Zagor>	Bagder: www.slimdevices.com
<Bagder>	thanks
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: 2 channel, yes
<PsycoXul>	well mp3 supports more than that
<PsycoXul>	at least mpeg2 layer3
<PsycoXul>	i dunno much about the actual format though
<Zagor>	still, we'd have to mix it *and* encode it in the cpu
<PsycoXul>	are multiple channels stored within single frames, or are channel frames interpolated?
<Zagor>	feel free to try, but I think it'll be hard
---	Linus|celebratin is now known as Linus
<Zagor>	i think it's in a single frame, but I'm not sure
<PsycoXul>	well there's pcm playback firmware in existance for the mas... i wonder how many channels it can support of pcm like that
<PsycoXul>	but pcm in low quality could probably be mixed by the sh1 maybe?
<Linus>	The PCm mode will probably support only 2 channels, since the application is stereo sound
<PsycoXul>	true
<Linus>	At least the interface to the DAC is only 2 channels
<Zagor>	well we have no pcm mode yet, so whoever writes that will decide :)
<Linus>	I pass
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	so what kind of input does the dac take from the mas?
<Linus>	It's a serial interface, clock, data and frame sync
<Linus>	two time slots one for left channel, one for right
<Linus>	16-bit or 32-bit

<Zagor>	hey
<adi|asleep>	you see any problem if i hack out a menu.c/h over the weekend 
<adi|asleep>	i figure im already noticing repetition in how ppl are looking to menu in the sim...
<adi|asleep>	figured i cold give us a basis..
<adi|asleep>	rather then reinventing the wheel.
<Zagor>	sure
<adi|asleep>	have you played with the sim recently?
<Zagor>	no
<adi|asleep>	ahh...
<adi|asleep>	well.. tetris plays a bit nicer and we have a basic screen saver.....

<Zagor>	nobody volunteered to help? ;)
<adi|asleep>	oh.. zagor.. ment to ask...
<PsycoXul>	nope heh
<adi|asleep>	in the contrib file...
<adi|asleep>	any reason your against const?
<Zagor>	yes, people tend to use it wrong
<PsycoXul>	so i take it opendir(),readdir(), etc don't work on target yet? heh
<Zagor>	opendir/readdir works for the root dir, but currently not for subdirs. i'm fixing that right now
<adi|asleep>	i have a habit of doing it.  bear with while i adjust :)
<adi|asleep>	okay.. off to bed.. need 2 hrs...
*	Zagor just got up :)
<adi|asleep>	hehhe i _should_ be just getting up...
<adi|asleep>	06:10... gotta love it..
<PsycoXul>	Zagor: how do i open the root directory?
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: opendir("/")
<PsycoXul>	hmm
<adi|asleep>	Psyco check out tree.h and tree.c
<PsycoXul>	well that doesn't seem to return on my unit
<adi|asleep>	in uisim/x11
<adi|asleep>	PsycoXul you need to add an "archos" dir
<PsycoXul>	i'm not talking about in the sim
<adi|asleep>	that is being used to simulate the '/' on the player
<PsycoXul>	i got the sim browser to work
<PsycoXul>	heh
<adi|asleep>	heheh ahh.. k
<PsycoXul>	lemme see where its having problems actualy..
<PsycoXul>	well first thing i notice is that on my player lcd_clear_display() misses the last 2 chars
<PsycoXul>	and next is that
<PsycoXul>	        dir=opendir("/");
<PsycoXul>	doesn't return
<PsycoXul>	unless there's something i need to do before it that i'm not
<Zagor>	look in test/fat
<PsycoXul>	heh thats kinda funny if you make clean with a clean tree it generates the dependancies and then removes them :p
<Zagor>	look in test/fat/main.c
<PsycoXul>	ok
<Zagor>	you need to run ata_init(), disk_init() and fat_mount() before you can start using the disk
<PsycoXul>	ah ok
<PsycoXul>	ok i see
<PsycoXul>	anything to call later like to umount or spindown or something?
<Zagor>	you don't have to, no writing is implemented yet so it's failsafe
<PsycoXul>	why is there a firmware/disk.h and firmware/common/disk.h
<Zagor>	firmware/disk.h will change, it's just a code container at the moment
<PsycoXul>	ok
<PsycoXul>	        lcd_puts(0,0,"Hello.");
<PsycoXul>	        if(ata_init()) {
<PsycoXul>	                lcd_puts(0,0,"Disk error");
<PsycoXul>	                return -1;
<PsycoXul>	        }       
<PsycoXul>	        lcd_puts(0,0,"ata init.");
<PsycoXul>	all i get is "Hello."
<Zagor>	the ata code is not target tested yet, I'll be doing that today
<PsycoXul>	ah
<Zagor>	now we know it doesn't work :)
<PsycoXul>	hehe

<Bagder>	hey ho
<Zagor>	hi
<Bagder>	I'm thinking about the played lcd API, when using x y coordinates, is 0 the first line and 1 the second?
<Bagder>	player
<Bagder>	can't see any reason why not, just checking
<Zagor>	i agree

*	Bagder starts to get the player simulator going
<Zagor>	have you seen adis latest items on the faq?
<Bagder>	nope
<Zagor>	s/latest/last/
<Zagor>	Q: But I _really_ want to talk with you in person.
<Zagor>	adiamas: I'm sorry.  My girlfriend/boyfriend/pet says I'm not allowed to, and the
<Zagor>	   doctors here won't let me have pens or pencils.  They say its some rule
<Zagor>	   about us not having sharp objects.  I'm sorry.  Now please stop calling me
<Zagor>	   here.
<Bagder>	ah yes
<Bagder>	that's a good one ;-)
<Zagor>	yes
<PsycoXul>	ok so how do i use custom chars on the player LCD with the new codebase? there an api for it?
<Bagder>	is that lcd_define_pattern() ?
<PsycoXul>	is it?
<Bagder>	I dunno ;-)
<Zagor>	yes
<Zagor>	I think so :)
<PsycoXul>	heh so how do i use it? 
<Zagor>	1. fix it
<Zagor>	2. use it 
<Zagor>	:)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Bagder>	3. add it to the simulator 
<PsycoXul>	hehe
<Zagor>	yup, those are the official docs
<Bagder>	I have to admit that my fixes to get the player-simulator running ain't the most beautiful ones you've seen
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	i just run my test code on my player 
<Bagder>	since I want to use the bitmap functions
<Bagder>	but simulate the charcell lcd api
<PsycoXul>	i'd honestly much rather have a bootloader than a simulator personally, just wish i knew the first clue about making one heh
*	Zagor just realized he has no sh-elf-gdb :(
*	Bagder commits
<PsycoXul>	hmmm....

<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	i dunno
<PsycoXul>	i do an lcd_puts and then a sleep(75); and then another lcd_puts() and i only get the 1st one
<Zagor>	you're on the cutting edge :)
<Zagor>	currently, sleep() only works right in the test/kernel code, since the main stuff doesn't have a timer interrupt enabled
<PsycoXul>	ah
<PsycoXul>	there an easy way to use it, or should i do something to sleep?
<Zagor>	i'd suggest a busy wait at the moment
<PsycoXul>	whats that? :p
<Zagor>	a for() loop instead of the sleep
<PsycoXul>	i see, so thats what thats called heh
<Zagor>	the term "busy" is used for when you don't allow other threads to execute
<PsycoXul>	ok now this loop is working but within it i'm doing key=button_get(); if(key) { switch(key) { case etc etc } } 
<PsycoXul>	i've got cases for BUTTON_DOWN, UP, ON, LEFT, RIGHT, and MENU, and default
<PsycoXul>	and with our without a button pressed it hits default
<PsycoXul>	s/our/or/
<Zagor>	sounds good
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	man
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	shouldn't a make clean rm */*.o too? and not generate dependancies? heh
<Zagor>	picky picky :)
<PsycoXul>	oh come ON... umount's gonna hang now again already? fuck
<Zagor>	usb-storage is far from perfect...
<PsycoXul>	well it needs to do something different thats for sure... can't accomplish much being forced to reboot at its random whims
<PsycoXul>	at least like TIME OUT or SOMETHING
<Zagor>	he's doing a big rewrite for 2.5
<PsycoXul>	reboot, turn the thing back on, plug it in, load the modules, copy a file and it hangs right there AGAIN
<PsycoXul>	not a whole lot of things get me upset... but having to reboot over and over again because of some stupid device that shouldn't be having any problems to start with, much less make me have to actualy interrupt my system usage, and having to wait months/years for the fix is exactly why i don't run some OTHER OS
<Zagor>	heh, yeah...
<Zagor>	you should consider the serial port fix
<PsycoXul>	goddamn i can't get this one little file copied on here now
<PsycoXul>	3 reboots and it STILL fucking up
<PsycoXul>	and then i'll still need to copy the real working firmware back on to there once i get this to work
<PsycoXul>	i'll probably have to fucknig juggle hardware, boot it to windows and scandisk, juggle hardware back, boot back to linux, probably have to reboot a few more times 
*	PsycoXul considers selling his archos and taking the money for vocal lessons
<PsycoXul>	hey i can store a lot more than 20G worth of music in my head :p
<Zagor>	:)
*	Zagor sings in a chamber choir
<PsycoXul>	ok so i made the default do
<PsycoXul>	snprintf(ugh,11,"%d",key);
<PsycoXul>	lcd_puts(0,0,ugh);
<Zagor>	ok
<PsycoXul>	i get 243 with no buttons, 242 for ON, 241 for menu, 227 for play/up, 211 for stop/down, 179 for left, and 115 for right
<PsycoXul>	and various others with combinations heh
<Zagor>	from button_get() ?
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<Zagor>	odd
<Zagor>	it should return 1,2,4,8 etc no?
<PsycoXul>	well looking at the code, thats what you'd think.. heh
<Zagor>	uhu
<PsycoXul>	same with or without calling button_init() first
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	btw i think portc & 0x10 gets triggered on the player when the stop buttons held for 3 seconds or whatever, just before it shuts off
<Zagor>	yes, that would be interesting
<PsycoXul>	i don't even know what & does... i don't know much if anything about binary and binary operations or low-level programming or anything like that though...
<PsycoXul>	my latest project with C was struggling to successfully read a wav header into a struct from stdin heh
<Zagor>	& is "and". portc & 0x10 tests if bit 4 is set in portc
<PsycoXul>	bit 4?
<Zagor>	yes, bit0 = 0x01, 1=0x02, 2=0x04, 3=0x08, 4=0x10
<PsycoXul>	ok
<PsycoXul>	know of any good online docs that'd teach me this kinda stuff? 
<Zagor>	umm, no
<Zagor>	:)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Zagor>	maybe http://www.learn-c.com/
<Zagor>	http://www.learn-c.com/boolean.htm
<PsycoXul>	cool.. i'll read that later... enough hax0ring stuff today for me heh
