<p>We often hang out on #rockbox over at irc.freenode.net
(freenode was once known as openprojects.net, see
<a href="http://freenode.net/">their web site</a> for more information).
Since there is a great deal of technical discussion, we log these sessions
for later reference.

<p>If you are lazy and don't want to download and install an IRC client, try visiting
Roland's <a href=http://rockbox.my-vserver.de/chat/chat.html>Java IRC page</a>.
