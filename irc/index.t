<p>Most development-related discussions take place on <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/rockbox">#rockbox</a> over at 
irc.libera.chat. Since there is a great deal of technical discussion, we log these sessions for later reference.

<p>Liberachat was formed after a hostile takeover of freenode; please see <a href="http://libera.chat/">Liberachat's 
web site</a> for more information.  <b>Please note that the old #rockbox and #rockbox-community channels on Freenode are
no longer logged or monitored, and we do not expect to retain operational control for much longer!</b></p>

<p>If you don't want to install an IRC client or are locked behind a 
firewall, try using <a href="https://web.libera.chat/?nick=WebGuest?#rockbox">Kiwi IRC</a>.
