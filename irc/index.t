<p>Most development-related discussions take place on <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/rockbox">#rockbox</a> over at 
irc.libera.chat. Since there is a great deal of technical discussion, we log these sessions for later reference.

<p>Liberachat was formed after a hostile takeover of freenode; please see <a href="http://libera.chat/">Liberachat's 
web site</a> for more information.
<b>Please note that we do not monitor, log, or have any sort of operational control over the former #rockbox and #rockbox-community channels on freenode.</b></p>

<p>If you don't want to install an IRC client or are locked behind a 
firewall, try using <a href="https://web.libera.chat/?nick=WebGuest?#rockbox">Kiwi IRC</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Please note that due to spam and other asshattery the #rockbox channel no longer allows unauthenticated/guest access.  We hope to lift this restriction eventually.</b></p>

<p>We have a bot on the #rockbox channel that responds to a few simple commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>g1234 or g#1234</b>: Info about gerrit change # 1234 </li>
<li><b>fs5678 or fs#5678</b>: Info about bug ticket # 5678 </li>
<li><b>r1234abcdef or r#1234abcdef</b>: Info about git commit hash starting with 1234abcdef</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above commands are case insensitive</p>
