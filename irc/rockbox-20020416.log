<Bagder> $ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/archos
<Bagder> mount: /dev/sda1 is not a valid block device
<Bagder> everything's the same as with my previous usb stuff
<Bagder> I only added the EHCI module
<Zagor> what does the kernel log look like when you plug in the device?
<Bagder> hub.c: USB new device connect on bus1/4, assigned device number 2
<Linus> Bagder: how is the Recorder formatted?
<Linus> or rather partitioned?
<Bagder> there's no difference 
<Bagder> it worked with my usb1.1
<Linus> Have you tried /dev/hda?
<Linus> And what sayeth your /proc filesystem?
<Linus> I am a moron. Of course I mean /dev/sda.
<Bagder> my /proc says a lot of course, any specifics?
<Zagor> /proc/scsi/scsi
<Linus> /proc/scsi/usb-storage or /proc/scsi/scsi
<Bagder> hm
<Bagder> $ cat /proc/scsi/scsi
<Bagder> Segmentation fault
<Zagor> ooh
<Linus> Ouch!
<Bagder> should I take away some of the other usb stuffs when I use ehci?
<Zagor> i don't think that should be necessary
<Bagder> this happened before too
<Bagder> when I used the wrong usb module
<Bagder> ohci
<Zagor> although i use usb as modules, so i rarely have everything loaded at the same time
<Bagder> well, since they must be modules I do too
<Zagor> they must be?
<Bagder> dunno for the new one though
<Bagder> yes
<Bagder> the other ones must be
<Bagder> at least for the menu stuff to work
<Zagor> i didn't know that
<Zagor> try /proc/bus/usb/devices
<Bagder> it might work to fiddle in the .config
<Bagder> and what am I looking for in there?
<Linus> Bagder: do you have a directory called /proc/scsi/usb-storage-*?
<Zagor> the isd300
<Bagder> Vendor=05ab ProdID=0060 ?
<Zagor> yes
<Linus> Bagder: are you sure that the usb-storage module is loaded?
<Bagder> no
<Linus> Check.
<Zagor> :)
<Bagder> so I need two modules?
<Zagor> the usb driver and usb-storage, yse
<Zagor> yes
<Bagder> didn't need that before...
<Zagor> in that case it was compiled-in
<Linus> Yes you did.
<Bagder> oh
<Bagder> I have that one built-in
<Zagor> hmm
<Linus> Sounds strange. You could try to have usb-storage as a module instead
<Bagder> yeps
<Bagder> reboot pending
<Bagder> I did in fact try it under windows yesterday ;-)
* Bagder hides
<Linus> *slap* (misses)
<Zagor> looser
<Bagder> I also tried to setup "internet sharing" in win98
<Linus> HAHAHA!
<Bagder> but failed to miserable I felt pain
<Bagder> so miserably even
<Zagor> you really are gullible... :)
<Bagder> it is *supposed* to work
<Linus> It does. But you have to know the secret handshake
<Bagder> it of course ended up with me having *three* cards defined and none of them were having my correct IP addresses
<Bagder> *g*
<Bagder> so it took 20 minutes to clean it all up again and get back to where I started ;-)
<Bagder> ... then I rebooted back to Linux 
<Bagder> phew
<Bagder> reboot

<Linus> Thanks!
<wavey> i bet the archos guys themselves are impressed at that
<Bagder> they should be at least
<wavey> wait until they see our screen savers :)
<Linus> I suspect that the Archos guys also used the serial port for debugging
<Zagor> I'm curious if anyone at Archos has heard about our project yet
<Bagder> right, I added the drawline function the other day
<Zagor> Bagder: how's the menu ideas coming along?
<wavey> Zagor: maybe. but they don't seem overly responsive for fixes or ideas from the public - so maybe they just don't give a shit?
<Bagder> Zagor: not much there yet
<wavey> my mate has the 1.26 rom, i'd like to know what changes went in
<wavey> the lists don't seem to indicate much changed
<Bagder> I'd like to see an API for reading keys
<Linus> Write one
<Bagder> then I can fake both input and display in the simulator
<Bagder> and produce something to try a menu system on
<Linus> Write one
<Bagder> I know I should
<Bagder> again
<Bagder> I need to take Alan code
<Bagder> and Gary code
<Bagder> and unity them
<Bagder> unite even
<Linus> Merge on. You have my full support. :-)
<Bagder> thanks, there's only the time issue left then ;-)
<Linus> Caffeine does wonders with time
<Bagder> hahaha
<Zagor> oh, you're not doing anything useful anyway ;)
<Linus> "Charging batteries" (internal joke)
<Bagder> oh, how did you know? ;-)
<Bagder> speaking of charging batteries, that's a man who we should "lure" in here to get started on some work :-)
<Bagder> Kjell
<Linus> That man can really do screensavers!
<Bagder> hehe right
<Bagder> we need a math library ;-)
<Bagder> Alan would love that!
* Bagder giggles

* Linus is having a Monty Python deja-vu
<Zagor> i was living in a cardboard box in the middle of the road
<Zagor> every morning we had to get up and lick the road clean
<Bagder> luxury!
<Linus> You were fortunate!
<Bagder> is there any way we can wait for a key input without just while()ing in a read?
<Bagder> I mean there's no irq or something?
<Zagor> i don't think so
<Zagor> nope
<Bagder> ok
<Zagor> PA[12-15] and PB[12-15] can trigger interrupts, but none of them are connected to a key
<Bagder> Alan's key.h file sure is confusing to me
<Bagder> well, perhaps not
<Bagder> but quite not what I want
<Zagor> uhhh, not a pretty sight
<Bagder> Gary's is more in my line of thinking
<wavey> anyone familiar with cygwin's setup process? how do i find out how to get a copy of /usr/share/dict?
<wavey> bah
<Zagor> i've never used cygwin
<wavey> perhaps i'll reboot into linux
<Bagder> I'll give ya a URL if you want
<wavey> please
<Bagder> I mean, the raw file
<wavey> ah, i can get that myself thanks anyhow
<Bagder> ok
<wavey> just wanted to get the proper cygwin version
<wavey> you know how interdependent these things can be
<wavey> you guys redhat or debian users/
<Zagor> both :)
<wavey> ok
<wavey> i love debian
<wavey> to death
* Bagder has a redhat 6 something, patched beyond recognition
<Zagor> i'm a long-time redhat user and a recent debian convert
<wavey> i remember installing slackware using 20+ floppies
<wavey> those were the days
<Zagor> hehe
<wavey> 386 
<wavey> 16 MB ram
<wavey> and my system kicked ass :)
<Zagor> which kernel version was that?
<wavey> wow
<wavey> that's going back some
<wavey> about a year before 2.0
* Bagder got the 0.01 kernel on a CD with a book he bought recently
<Zagor> empty cd...
<Bagder> well, there were other kernel releases too ;-)
<Zagor> ah
<Bagder> "Linux core kernel code commentary"
<Bagder> nice reading before falling asleep at night ;-)
<Zagor> that's cheating!
<wavey> the oreilly kernel book is very good
<Bagder> I got that one too
<Bagder> device drivers volume 2
* Zagor has a bloody zoo in the bookshelf
<wavey> heh yeah
<wavey> luckily they expense books at my current company
<wavey> i bought 40 over the last couple years
<Zagor> yeah, same here
<wavey> i stroke my bookshelf at night
<Zagor> hehe
<Bagder> hahaha
<wavey> my fiancee is getting jealous
<wavey> is the device drivers book worth getting?
* Bagder 's wife fainted when she saw the "kernel commentary" book ;-)
<wavey> i was tempted
<Bagder> "what *is* that!" ;-)
<Linus> The device drivers book is a must
* wavey makes mental note
<Bagder> do we have any good pictures of a player and a recorder taken on the keys/lcd ?
<Bagder> ah http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/internals/archos1.jpg is a good one on the player
<Bagder> we have no good ones of the recorder though
<Zagor> i can take some
<Bagder> I'd like a web page with two frontal pics next to each other
<Bagder> player/recorder
<Bagder> makes it more clear to people (and me) how much they differ
* Bagder thinks ui/input stuff
<Zagor> ok
* Linus is starving
<Zagor> preferrably with the displays lit
<Zagor> off to lunch
<Bagder> yes
<Linus> Lunch!!!
<Bagder> food
