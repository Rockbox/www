--- Topic for #rockbox is Open Source Jukebox Firmware - http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/
--- Topic for #rockbox set by Zagor at Fri Apr 12 15:45:52
--> Zagor2 (~bjst@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
--- Zagor2 is now known as Zagor
<Zagor> morning
<Bagder> hey
<Zagor> cool hack of the day:
<Zagor> Adbusters is buying a 30 second commercial spot on CNN tomorrow
<Zagor> and they're airing....nothing
<Bagder> :-)
--> wavey (~wavey@dlan1431.dircon.co.uk) has joined #rockbox
<Zagor> 30 second black screen
<Bagder> at least it was cheap to manifacture ;-)
<Zagor> hehe
<wavey> morn, boys
<Bagder> hey wavey
<Zagor> hi wavey
<Zagor> apparently the spot cost $5000 to purchase
<wavey> i tried compiling firmware last night, and it complained of missing .h files
<wavey> fakestore or something
<Zagor> yeah, that's the fat code. it's not compilable
<wavey> ah.
<wavey> ok
<wavey> is it normal to have noncompilable code in cvs?
<wavey> in a major build target?
<Zagor> not really, but this is the first version of most files
<wavey> hmm
<wavey> i guess
<Bagder> it hasn't really set yet
<wavey> what's there looks good
<wavey> i got most of it compiled on windows thru cygwin
<Bagder> that cool
<Bagder> that's 
<wavey> needed to mod the makefile to include cygwin's distributed include dirs, etc
<wavey> once we have a compilable codebase, we should mandate that it's always compilable from then on - sensible?
<Bagder> yes
<Bagder> imho
<wavey> otherwise it holds up dev
<Bagder> indeed, there will be many people using the code base then
<Bagder> but feel free to correct the problems and mail us patches! ;-)
<wavey> sure - will do :)
--> linus__ (~linus@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
--- Bagder gives channel operator status to Zagor
<wavey> can someone add me as a registered dev on the rockbox sourceforge project pls
<wavey> mister_wavey is my sf login
* Bagder points in Zagor's direction
<Zagor> sure
<wavey> cheers
<Bagder> today's security flaw: IE back button ;-)
<wavey> heh
<wavey> which webapp is misbehaving?
<Bagder> the back button can run javascript
<Zagor> stuart martin, mister_wavey, Developer
<wavey> zag: lovely
<Bagder> wavey: to commit anything to CVS, you need to checkout the repo using ssh first
<Bagder> before you did it read-only
<linus__> Strange. When I connect from work, I am allowed to use the nick "Linus", but not from home. ???
<Bagder> linus__: muh is still running and uses it probably
<Zagor> that's because from work you are connecting via "muh", which is holding the Linus name for you
<linus__> AAh IC.
<linus__> Bagder: muh is running on labb, or...?
<Zagor> yes
<linus__> Så hur kopplar jag upp mig mot den?
* Bagder detects swedish BZZZZZ
* Bagder grins
<Zagor> connect your irc client to labb:9997
<linus__> OK. CU!
<-- linus__ has quit ("Client Exiting")
--> Linus (~linus@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<Bagder> tadaaa
<Linus> WOW! It worked!
<Bagder> nomad claims 22 hours battery time
<Bagder> http://www.nomadworld.com/products/Jukebox3/
<Zagor> ...and the reviews report 10-12 hours
<Bagder> :-)
<Linus> I got my soldering station yesterday. I made another debugging cable just to test it.
<Bagder> ... and now you sell it to the highest bidder? B-]
<Zagor> ah, good. because i got my archos swapped today!
<Linus> Rock'n'roll!
* Bagder reads "Any one out there linking the curl C library with a COBOL program?"
<Bagder> :-)
* Bagder bounces, a commit mail from wavey!
<wavey> heh
<wavey> cygwin makes hell bearable
<Bagder> yeah, cygwin's pretty decent
<wavey> i've installed cygwin's ssh
<Zagor> lunch
<wavey> does the use of ssh produce a public key somewhere on my filesystem>
<wavey> ?
<wavey> or do i need to make my own
<Bagder> you don't need one if you don't want to
<Bagder> but ssh-keygen makes them
<wavey> i'd like to store the key with sourceforge
<Bagder> ah, then ssh-keygen is the answer
<Bagder> -t dsa or -t rsa
<Bagder> depending on which kind of key you want
<Bagder> or one at a time to get both kinds
<Bagder> they're normally store in ~/.ssh
<Bagder> stored
<wavey> do i want a passphrase on this?
<Bagder> yes
<wavey> ok cool
<wavey> how long does a cvs login session last for?
<Bagder> forever
<wavey> ok cool
<Bagder> until you logout
<wavey> ok waiting for the sourceforge batch process to use my key :)
<Bagder> ok
<Bagder> yes, it's nicer that way
<Bagder> the cvs page isn't complete in that aspect either...
<Bagder> as it doesn't explain the whole process to get the no-prompting to work
<wavey> well, the ssh-keygen would be a useful addition
<Bagder> yes
<Bagder> you'll also need to run ssh-agent and ssh-add
--> alkorr (jbcoax@srs07v-3-253.n.club-internet.fr) has joined #rockbox
<alkorr> hi
<alkorr> good it works with WinCVS now (much easier to add or to update than with CVS command line)
<-- alkorr has quit (Client Quit)
<wavey> yuk
<wavey> GUIs are evil
<wavey> except directory browsers, i guess
<Bagder> I agree
<wavey> and therefore cvs integration makes sense
<Bagder> people tell me the wincvs interface is really crappy though
<wavey> ssh-agent and ssh-add are needed where?
<Bagder> when sf knows your key
<wavey> ok, what do i need to do?
<Bagder> run "eval `ssh-agent`" and then "ssh-add"
<Bagder> it starts an "agent" for your key
<Bagder> and adds your key to it
<Bagder> which then passes it to the server when used
<wavey> ah
<wavey> ok taa
<Bagder> so for ssh-add you need to enter your pass phrase
<Bagder> once
<Bagder> and after that all cvs operations are with no prompts
<Bagder> now, I honestly don't know how to put that short and nice in the cvs web page ;-)
<wavey> :)
<wavey> ooh
<wavey> still being prompted - c'mon sf! get your batches running! :)
<Bagder> you'll see on the prompt when you can expect the non-prompt to work
<Bagder> it depends on which pass phrase it asks for
<wavey> and the passphrase for the key is good for the length of the login session?
<Bagder> um, yes, but the "login" session with ssh is just the single operation. unless you meant the passphrase to ssh-add which is good as long as you keep ssh-agent running
<wavey> ah ok
<wavey> and to restart the agent after reboot?
<wavey> eval `ssh-agent` again?
<Bagder> yes
<wavey> coolio
<Bagder> then ssh-add and add your pass phrase
<Bagder> s/add/enter
<wavey> ok
<wavey> how do i get on the cvs notification list?
<wavey> i couldn't see instructions anywhere
<wavey> the mail archive needs a search tool too, ideally
<Bagder> Björn mailed about it
<Bagder> yes it does
<Bagder> To get these mails, send a mail to majordomo@cool.haxx.se, with the text (no subject) "subscribe rockbox-cvs".
<wavey> aha, just found it :) thanks
