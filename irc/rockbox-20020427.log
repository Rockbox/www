<adiamas>	okay... logging again :)
<adiamas>	i mailed the log from the 26th out
<Zagor>	to the list?
<adiamas>	sorry.. not mailed... cvs'd
<Zagor>	ah
<Zagor>	did you update the .t file too?
<adiamas>	nope.. ill get that..
<adiamas>	done
<Zagor>	I tried to add a cron job, but got some permission problems so it's still manual
<Bagder>	lids related?
<Zagor>	I don't know. I'll find the error mail
<Zagor>	Subject: Cron <bjst@labb> (cd $HOME/bjorn_html/rockbox; cvs update; make)
<Zagor>	rcmd: socket: Permission denied
<Zagor>	cvs [update aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages if any)
<Zagor>	ah
<Zagor>	it's not having CVS_RSH=ssh
<Bagder>	but it shouldn't
<Bagder>	you should update anonymously
<Zagor>	ah, yes. I *should* :-)
<Bagder>	aaaaah
<Bagder>	say no more ;-)
<Zagor>	trying again
<Zagor>	GOTCHA
<Zagor>	cross-sector filenames now work too
<Zagor>	it ain't pretty, but it works :)
<Bagder>	heh, I hope you smack on some comments explaining the non-prettiness
<Zagor>	i'm trying...
<Zagor>	it's the sector caching that makes a mess
<Zagor>	i'll check it in so you can take a look
<Bagder>	sure!
<Zagor>	it's in
<Zagor>	at the bottom, fat_getnext()
<Bagder>	one sec
<Bagder>	its not that bad really
<Zagor>	i found an unnecessary line: ptr = ent->cached_buf
<Bagder>	on 963?
<Zagor>	no, 971
<Bagder>	ah
<Bagder>	right
<Zagor>	since it's already being done on 963
<Zagor>	removing that, I can collapse the ifs a bit
<Zagor>	i'd say this moves the fat code into GREEN status
*	Bagder horrays
<Zagor>	what a difference a day makes :)
*	Bagder presses reload on the rockbox page like crazy
<Zagor>	hehe
<Zagor>	now
<Bagder>	plopp
<Bagder>	7 green ones
<Bagder>	9 yellow to go
<Zagor>	yeah
<Bagder>	we should write a little converter for pics to our internal pixmap format
<Bagder>	did you write one for gifs to some odd format?
<Bagder>	thinking about the rockbox logo now
<Zagor>	no that was hand-pixeled by thomas
<Bagder>	yes, but I recall something about you doing something like that on Siemens?
<Bagder>	a converter that is
<Zagor>	ah, yes
<Zagor>	umm, i can't remember the name of the format :)
<Bagder>	in fact
<Bagder>	just loading a software showing the logo will make a *great* foto
<Zagor>	yup
<Zagor>	PPM i think the format is called
<Zagor>	portable pixmap
<Bagder>	ah yes
<Bagder>	I'll hack up a little app embryo right now
<Zagor>	the simulator should be able to do this, right?
<Bagder>	do what?
<Zagor>	run this app, showing the logo
<Bagder>	yes
<Zagor>	if you run it, include the ata code and run ata_init(). that should prevent it locking the disk.
<Zagor>	ah, the cron job works now
<Bagder>	fine
<Bagder>	but I'm not gonna try running it on target yet
<Zagor>	I can understand that :)
<Zagor>	we should fix an unlock patch for the usb 2.0 driver too.
<Bagder>	that would be really good
<Bagder>	I'll make it possible to start tetris from the app's menu
<Bagder>	:-)
<Zagor>	:)
<Bagder>	hm, doesn't work
<Zagor>	what's the problem?
<Bagder>	I can't manage to get the "cursor" to show up
<Zagor>	cursor?
<Bagder>	I have three lines in a "menu"
<Zagor>	ah
<Bagder>	and I want to move a "marker" along the side of them
<Zagor>	i see
<Bagder>	hm
<Bagder>	I need to force a screen update somehow I guess
<Bagder>	of course I do
<Bagder>	silly me
<Zagor>	yes :)
<Bagder>	yes, and clear the marker when I move away... :-)
<Zagor>	ok, time for file.c
<Bagder>	roxxers
<Bagder>	hehe, now I can start tetris from the menu ;-)
<Zagor>	nice!
<Bagder>	gotta clear the screen first though
<Zagor>	hmm, both the man pages for remove() and unlink() claim POSIX conformance
<Zagor>	remove() is undoubtedly a better name
<Bagder>	it is
<adiamas>	well.. depends on how you look at it...
<adiamas>	you aren't really 'removing' the file from the system...
<adiamas>	you are more so 'unlink'ing it from the system
<Zagor>	you're removing it from view :)
<adiamas>	but your also unlinking it from the file system ;)
<Bagder>	hey you can't drop the block in tetris!
<Zagor>	no, only speed it up
*	Bagder made the x11 lcd display flicker free now
<Bagder>	try the new uisim
<Bagder>	just committed
<Zagor>	lots of updates :)
<Zagor>	how do you select an entry?
<Bagder>	right
<Zagor>	ah
<Bagder>	but you can't leave tetris ;-)
<Bagder>	I better fix that
<Zagor>	still, our first menu!
<Bagder>	I like that big font
<Zagor>	hehe
<Bagder>	now
<Bagder>	should I move the X11 stuff into a subdir?
<Bagder>	or should I put the app stuff in a subdir?
<Zagor>	put X11 in a subdir
<Bagder>	it makes sense
<Zagor>	then we put all apps in the root and just link to win32 or x11
<Bagder>	of course, the app stuff should probably be in the firmware dir...
<Zagor>	yeah, but I expect we'll have lots of little "toy apps" mainly for the simulator
<Bagder>	oh yes!
<Bagder>	do we have a sleep() yet?
<Zagor>	well we have it
<Zagor>	but it's not working right on target, since we haven't set up the timer interrupt yet
<Bagder>	I was just thinking how I should proceed to slow my app down ;-)
<Zagor>	sleep(ticks)
<Bagder>	why not sleep(ms)
<Bagder>	prevents ms/MS_PER_TICK all over ;-)
<Zagor>	use HZ/freq instead
<Zagor>	no reason really, it's just the simplest implementation
<Bagder>	doesn't really matter, we can have both ;-)
<Zagor>	yup
<Bagder>	now, which key do we stop tetris with?
<Zagor>	a function key
<Zagor>	or OFF
<Bagder>	I'll use off for now
<Bagder>	oh what fun ;-)
<Zagor>	:)
<Bagder>	add a big "Tetris" text too for the fun of it
<Bagder>	´ed
<Bagder>	bed time

*	adiamas screams at this stupid person
<adiamas>	my god.. i wasn't happy totally with this guys id3 editor..
<adiamas>	so i started digging into it...
<PsycoXul>	heh
<adiamas>	it has to be -the- worst design and execution of code i have ever seen
<PsycoXul>	i did the same thing with grip
<adiamas>	lets have a struct of data, that also has bools in it that tell you if that data field needs to be edited.
<adiamas>	why?
<adiamas>	so you can pass it around your functions.
<adiamas>	but lets be_really_ lazy and use getopt and rely on the externs

<adiamas>	who hacked out the tetris file again?

---	Bagderzzz is now known as Bagder
<edx|studying>	hi bagder :)
<Bagder>	hey
<Bagder>	I moved the x11 sim stuff to its own dir yesterday
<edx|studying>	yea i just updated :)
<Bagder>	so now we both could use the app.c and tetris.c in the uisimulator root
<edx|studying>	good idea.
<adiamas>	nods
<adiamas>	who wrote the tetris originally?
<Bagder>	"Mattis Wadman"
<edx|studying>	there is another problem with the tetris code.
<edx|studying>	that give me a macro redefinition:
<edx|studying>	#define HAVE_RECORDER_KEYPAD
<edx|studying>	what do i do about it?
<adiamas>	ahh hehhe
<edx|studying>	(you need this define there?)
<edx|studying>	i compile with ARCHOS_RECORDER defined the this is defined automatically.
<Bagder>	uh, no it shouldn't be there
<edx|studying>	ok ill delete it
<adiamas>	im trying to understand wtf is happening with the block_dat
<adiamas>	data 
<edx|studying>	another thing...
<edx|studying>	unistd.h
<edx|studying>	is not for windows
<adiamas>	same #define is in the x11 should it be there?
<edx|studying>	so im gonna do that:
<edx|studying>	#ifndef _WIN32
<edx|studying>	#include <unistd.h>
<edx|studying>	#endif
<adiamas>	right edx
<edx|studying>	also, for sleep, kernel.h must be included by tetris.c
<edx|studying>	(or app.c)
<Bagder>	well, there is no target version of sleep() yet
<edx|studying>	there is.
<edx|studying>	kernel.c i think
<edx|studying>	i have seen it..
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	but it doesn't work
<adiamas>	Bagder in tetris.c could you tell me what 'frame' is with respect to block_data?
<Bagder>	eeeh
<Bagder>	I don't know really
<adiamas>	k... ill figure it out one way or another..
<edx|studying>	Bagder: how do yo uselect a menu entry? :)
*	adiamas begins to think that the numbness in his left pinky and ring finger is _not_ a good thing
<Bagder>	go right
<Bagder>	but tetris is the only one you can select ;-)
<edx|studying>	ok
<edx|studying>	:)
<edx|studying>	ill upload updated files that are compatible with win32 simulator.
<edx|studying>	ok?
<Bagder>	do that
<Bagder>	I'll make sure the x11 runs fine with em
<edx|studying>	yep
<edx|studying>	go ahead ;)
<adiamas>	edx.. do you understand the block struct?
<Bagder>	done, and modified the app.c and tetris.c slightly
<Bagder>	no more unistd.h :-)
<edx|studying>	ok
<edx|studying>	neither for linux nor for windows :)
<edx|studying>	have you commited them yet?
<Bagder>	yes
<edx|studying>	ok
<Bagder>	you can press 'off' to abort tetris now
<Bagder>	(which is the numerical keypad enter in my case)
<edx|studying>	yea - i use the same keycodes
<edx|studying>	ok great :)
<edx|studying>	the menu still moves a little fast :)
<edx|studying>	(tetris too)
<edx|studying>	how is it on linux?
<Bagder>	that sleep is 1 second for mee
<Bagder>	which makes everything a bit too slow ;-)
<edx|studying>	oh lol
<edx|studying>	sleep 1 is defined Sleep (1000/HZ * 1) for me
<edx|studying>	which is 1/10 second ;)
<Bagder>	heh
<Bagder>	the target sleep() takes 'ticks' as argument and we don't know yet how fast that is
<Bagder>	so I haven't bothered
<edx|studying>	yea
<edx|studying>	bjorn said it was deifined with HZ (but maybe that value is not accurate yet)
<edx|studying>	its 1/100 second btw..
<edx|studying>	not 1/10
<adiamas>	edx... do you understand the block_data structure?
<edx|studying>	no matter.. thats the least problem.
<edx|studying>	adiamas: no i didnt really read the code
<Bagder>	edx|studying: oh, right, haven't seen that
<adiamas>	k...
<edx|studying>	adi: wait a sec
<edx|studying>	hmm strange...
<edx|studying>	does it already contain rotoation... ?
<edx|studying>	            lcd_drawpixel(start_x+x+block_data[block][frame][0][i],
<edx|studying>	looking at that.. the first array parameter contains the block #..
<edx|studying>	the second one the frame (?) - maybe rotation?
<edx|studying>	the third parameter is either 0 or 1.. but i dont know why
<adiamas>	nods
<edx|studying>	nods?
<Bagder>	"To lower and raise the head quickly, as in agreement or acknowledgment."
<edx|studying>	ahh 
*	edx|studying nods too
<edx|studying>	was just irritated because you didnt write it as a /me msg ;)
<edx|studying>	i guess the four integers are the directions.. (block_data is seperated into 4-int blocks)
<adiamas>	i just don't see the blocks there...
*	adiamas shrugs
<edx|studying>	the first block is the square thingie..
<edx|studying>	im playing around with it now
<edx|studying>	aha.. uhm..
<adiamas>	so: {{0,1,0,1},{0,0,1,1}} is a square?
<edx|studying>	i got it!
<adiamas>	k.. shoot
<edx|studying>	*snip!*
<edx|studying>	one block always consists of four pixels!
<edx|studying>	{0,1,0,1},{0,0,1,1}
<edx|studying>	coordinate of first pixel:
<edx|studying>	(0,0)
<edx|studying>	of second pixel: (1,0) ; of third pix (0,1) of fourth pixel (1,1)
<edx|studying>	can you see how i do it
<edx|studying>	nth pixel coord = (data[0][n],data[1][n])
<adiamas>	ahhhh!!! got ya...
<adiamas>	can you do me a favor.. write that in a comment above it?
*	adiamas likes comments that make sense.
<edx|studying>	heheh sure :)
*	adiamas is toast...
<adiamas>	is it:
<adiamas>	x
<adiamas>	|
<adiamas>	|
<adiamas>	----y
<adiamas>	or is it 
<adiamas>	y|

<edx|studying>	hi :)
<Zagor>	hi
<Bagder>	edx|studying: that tetris.c in the win32 dir should be removed now shouldn't it?
<edx|studying>	aehm - yea wait a sec
<edx|studying>	ok it is
<Bagder>	:-)
<Zagor>	is there any way to make 'sed' not use / for its' regex?
<Bagder>	yes
*	edx|studying doesnt understand a word
<Bagder>	Zagor: just use it after the s
<Bagder>	sxmooxpoo
<Zagor>	ok. strange that the man page doesn't say that
<edx|studying>	what's 'sed'
<Bagder>	one of those secret tricks ;-)
<edx|studying>	heh give me the man page ;)
<Bagder>	sed is a dead cool unix command line tool
<edx|studying>	what does it do?
<Bagder>	uh, replaces regexes in a stream ;-)
<edx|studying>	what are regexes
<edx|studying>	(sorry for asking so much)
<Bagder>	regex is a pattern, similar to wildcard but a lot more advanced and powerful
<edx|studying>	ah ok
<edx|studying>	that is like *.[mp3|m3u] or something like that?
<Bagder>	".*(mp3|m3u)$" would be good regex for that
<edx|studying>	aha
<edx|studying>	that $ indicates that the ( and ) do not belong to the name?
<Bagder>	no, $ matches end of string
<Bagder>	so that the mp3 or m3u must end it
<edx|studying>	ahh
<edx|studying>	ok - really advanced ;)
<Bagder>	right, and this is only scratching on the surface
<edx|studying>	hehe
<edx|studying>	what does sxmooxpoo do?
<edx|studying>	lol
<Bagder>	it replaces all occurrances of 'moo' with 'poo' :-)
<edx|studying>	so sed can also rename files?
<Bagder>	no, it replaces text in a stream
<Bagder>	cat file | sed -e s/replace/this > newfile
<edx|studying>	ok
<edx|studying>	couldnt one use it for filenames as well.. i have needed something like that a couple of times ;)
<Bagder>	sure you can
<Bagder>	in unix you just write up a quick script to do it
<edx|studying>	hehe
<PsycoXul>	its easier in bash than with sed unless you wanna do things that bash can't do 
<PsycoXul>	heh
*	Bagder jumps, PsycoXul is alive ;-)
<PsycoXul>	like 'for f in *;do mv $f `echo $f | sed -e s/bleh/blah/g`;done' or 'for f in *;do mv $f ${f//bleh/blah};done'
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	or whatever :p
<PsycoXul>	Bagder: yeah
<Zagor>	that's precisely what I was doing, only "bleh" contained a full path with / characters
<Zagor>	dependency generation now fixed for 'firmware'
*	edx|studying shakes awestruck
*	adiamas cocks his head to the side and stares at edx
<adiamas>	what awestrikes you?
<edx|studying>	"like 'for f in *;do mv $f `echo $f | sed -e s/bleh/blah/g`;done' or 'for f in *;do mv $f ${f//bleh/blah};done'"
<Bagder>	unix in a nutshell
<Zagor>	actually, it's only: for d in $(DEPDIRS); do { if [ ! -d $$d ]; then mkdir $$d; fi; }; done
<Zagor>	but then
<edx|studying>	what the heck das that do?
<Zagor>	$(CC) -MM $(CFLAGS) $< |sed '\''s|\($*\)\.o[ :]*|\1.o $(<:%.c=%.d) : |g'\'' > $@; [ -s $@ ] || rm -f $@
*	Bagder falls off his chair laughing
<Zagor>	it creates the directories listed in $(DEPDIRS) if they don't already exists
*	edx|studying cries out despairing
<edx|studying>	what does "fi;" do there?
<Zagor>	it's the end of "if"
<edx|studying>	ahh lol
<adiamas>	think: if(true){  }
<PsycoXul>	hmm
<edx|studying>	what does the second thing do?
<Zagor>	it runs the dependency generator, with, umm, correct parameters :)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<edx|studying>	hm.. aha
*	adiamas thinks we need to get edx to dual boot his box ;)
<Zagor>	yup
<edx|studying>	i can use vmware ;)
<edx|studying>	you guys know that, right?
<edx|studying>	$< |sed '\''s|\($*\)\.o[ :]*|\1.o $(<:%.c=%.d) : |g'\'' > that inserts the return value of sed ??
<adiamas>	edx trust me dude... once you get off windows, you don't go back...
<edx|studying>	adi: i have tried that a lot of times - i always came back ;)
<edx|studying>	i dont even have the latest linux installation file
<edx|studying>	where do i get it :)
<edx|studying>	can i d/l it somewhere?
*	adiamas has always done his installs off cd, so i cant tell you.
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	linux installation file?
<edx|studying>	well .. the cd image or whatever
<Zagor>	http://mirrors.sunsite.dk/debian-netinst-cd/
<edx|studying>	you use debian?
<PsycoXul>	Zagor: if it has / chars its easier with sed using like sed -e #eh/blah/bleh#eh/blah/blah#g
<Zagor>	not for this machine, but for others
<edx|studying>	"these images are intended for developers, administrators, and advanced users"  ** ohoh
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: I know, i'm using | in this expression
<PsycoXul>	with bash's substitution you have to use / chars for the sub so you have to escape any /'s within it
<PsycoXul>	yeah, with sed you can use i think any char
*	edx|studying loads the iso @ 40kb/sek
<edx|studying>	why is it only 30 megs?
<Zagor>	because it's a netinstall
<PsycoXul>	because its net install
<PsycoXul>	heh
<edx|studying>	ok
<edx|studying>	that wont work - i bet!
<PsycoXul>	why not?
<edx|studying>	it's linux - why would net install work on linux :P
<Zagor>	it works fine, but maybe you're not ripe for debian yet :)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<edx|studying>	i will install with vmware - so it is no problem to remove it any time :P
<PsycoXul>	forget vmware :p
<PsycoXul>	you can't *really* use an os in vmware :p
<edx|studying>	why noy
<PsycoXul>	well
<PsycoXul>	what're you gonna do with it?
<edx|studying>	try the console commands you post lol
<PsycoXul>	i mean its like making a system thats half of your real one but without direct hardware access

<Zagor>	all of it :)
<edx|studying>	haha
<edx|studying>	how much hd space do you have :)
<Zagor>	80 gigs

<edx|studying>	i am not that far yet
<Bagder>	night adiamas
<edx|studying>	Next: Install the base system
<edx|studying>	night..
<edx|studying>	*pressing enter*
<edx|studying>	Please selecte the medium you will use to install blah..
<edx|studying>	that is CDRom Drive, right?
<Zagor>	network
<edx|studying>	heh.. ok network is n/a
<Zagor>	bah. told you vmware was no good
<edx|studying>	i didnt configure drivers yet.. wait a sec
<edx|studying>	bah.. it does not contain a device driver for my card
<Zagor>	you're not having a card, you're having vmware
<edx|studying>	i do have a card
<Zagor>	it uses a special virtual network interface
<edx|studying>	vmware makes it :o)
<Zagor>	yes
<edx|studying>	it would not support my adapter anyways
<edx|studying>	it only has 2 dlink cards listed
<Zagor>	which dlink do you have?
<Zagor>	most dlinks are NE2000 compatible
<edx|studying>	yea i was gonna try that
<edx|studying>	D-Link DFE-530TX
<edx|studying>	PCI NE2000 support
<edx|studying>	that's ok?
<Bagder>	"Cheap, drivers installed perfectly, Linux support. "
<Bagder>	(googled quote)
<Zagor>	sounds ok
<edx|studying>	"installation failed"
<edx|studying>	why cant it do like windows and determine drivers itself?
<edx|studying>	:P
*	Bagder smacks edx
<Zagor>	it did for me. try native and you'll se
<edx|studying>	never ever am i gonna try native unless i want to destroy my windows :P
<Bagder>	the via-rhine driver it should be
<Bagder>	http://www.dlink.co.uk/support/linux_supp.html
<Zagor>	repartition the disk so you get a couple of gigs free, then there's no worry
<edx|studying>	thanks bagder.. tulip aha
<edx|studying>	wont work either
<Bagder>	tulip?
<Bagder>	via-rhine
<edx|studying>	that is the driver name
<edx|studying>	ooops!
<edx|studying>	right, thanks
<edx|studying>	fails anyways
*	edx|studying does not know any command-line arguments
<edx|studying>	for the network adapter
<edx|studying>	what filesystem shall i install on the hd?
<Zagor>	ext2
<edx|studying>	k
<edx|studying>	and a linux swap?
<Zagor>	yes
<edx|studying>	Extended = ext2?
<Zagor>	yes
<Bagder>	I'll run off and shop some food, back in an hour or so
<edx|studying>	*all thse sunday-shopping people* - i wish that was possible in Germany
<Zagor>	it's really strange that you can't buy stuff on weekends
<edx|studying>	it is strange that you can ;)
<edx|studying>	on saturdays we can till 1PM (on every fourth saturday till 4PM)
<edx|studying>	but that is all
<Zagor>	Are gas stations open?
<edx|studying>	yea
<edx|studying>	but they are expensive
<Zagor>	of course, they have no competition
<Zagor>	government mandated monopolies are usually quite expensive...
<edx|studying>	debian is still checking for bad blocks on the hd.. ill see what i can do after that..
<edx|studying>	yea
<Zagor>	how big partition are you using?
<edx|studying>	4GB and 300mB for swap
<Zagor>	ok
<edx|studying>	i guess the bigges problem is the vmware network adapter
<Zagor>	it shouldn't take long, but i guess everything is a bit slower under vmware
<edx|studying>	yea
<edx|studying>	its 2/3 finished
<edx|studying>	i'll try an ethernet driver maybe...

<edx|studying>	hi
<calpefrosch>	hi
<calpefrosch>	have to done something at the simulator ?
<edx|studying>	Zagor: Note: If the virtual machine's Ethernet adapter has been enabled, the installation program will auto-detect and load the AMD PC/Net 32 driver
<edx|studying>	yea
<edx|studying>	but the file system thing is not working :/
<edx|studying>	it gives me an error i just cant fix!
<Zagor>	edx|studying: I added file.h and dir.h to firmware/common yesterday, so you know the API
<Zagor>	we renamed unlink() to remove()
<calpefrosch>	I will update the code tomorrow at work. I have no VC++ at home.
<edx|studying>	oh.. I added that file to - but didnt commit
<edx|studying>	ok
<Zagor>	hehe
<edx|studying>	At the "Network Configuration" screen, respond OK to use the default: Use bootp/dhcp. 
<Zagor>	do you have a fixed ip or dhcp?
<edx|studying>	in LAN i have dhcp
<Zagor>	then use that
<edx|studying>	well i am not that far yet
<Zagor>	k
<edx|studying>	AMD PC/Net 32 driver.. i hope that one exists
<edx|studying>	(and works)
<calpefrosch>	what do you use to organize the MP3 files ? I have about 10 GB.
<edx|studying>	heh ntfs file system - nothing actually :)
<Zagor>	directories :)
<calpefrosch>	mhh, good idea. but how to search one song ?
<calpefrosch>	I mean, on the archos...
<Zagor>	oh
<Zagor>	you need a good system...
<Zagor>	in your head and in your archos :)
<edx|studying>	genre/artist/album/name.mp3
<calpefrosch>	hmm, I think I'm to lazy... ;-)
<calpefrosch>	ok, I have to organzie some files, hehe

<edx|studying>	(that is re)
<edx|studying>	no success installing debian :(
<edx|studying>	it wont work with the network adapter
<Bagder>	annoying
<edx|studying>	really.
<PsycoXul>	anybody ever seen these things? http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/computing/5a15.shtml
<PsycoXul>	edx|studying: what network adapter
<PsycoXul>	debian should have no problems with vmware's emulated nic
<edx|studying>	PsycoXul: D-LINK 530X
<Bagder>	weird gadget
<edx|studying>	yea its the vmware bridged network adapter
<edx|studying>	what does this soundbug do?
<edx|studying>	play music aloud?

<edx|studying>	hi alan.
<edx|studying>	i made a makefile for uisw32
<alkorr>	good
<alkorr>	did you commit ?
<edx|studying>	yea
<Bagder>	it'll probably need adjusting though after yesterday night
<edx|studying>	maybe..
<edx|studying>	no actually not
<edx|studying>	teh file.h inside the firmware dir needs tho
<alkorr>	weird i didn't receive any new CVS commits in my emailbox...
<edx|studying>	nobody does currently i think
<Bagder>	the commits mails are absent right now
<Bagder>	we've commited like crazy, but no mails...
<alkorr>	but i did receive a test from Björn
<alkorr>	edx: you should have a lookup in this page : http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1598.asp
<edx|studying>	but writing in SDL is so much more work..
<edx|studying>	SDL is a nice interface :) - but it is not thought for such use
<alkorr>	i don't think so, there would be less code to write
<edx|studying>	i dont think there would be less code to write.
<edx|studying>	look at it now - its less than 100 lines win32 specific code
<alkorr>	yes but the main goal is to have the same code for Linux and Windows, even people from MacOS and other unixes should be able to use the same code
<alkorr>	anyway you are not interested by a SDL port ?
<Bagder>	alkorr: if you make one, we'll surely be interested

<calpefrosch>	is there somewhere a file.c ?
<edx|studying>	only for simulator.
<edx|studying>	file-win32.c
<edx|studying>	you dont really need it tho.
<edx|studying>	al teh functions are native (stdio.h , io.h)
<calpefrosch>	yes, but I have a book "C Programmierung lernen" in my hands.
<edx|studying>	hehe
<calpefrosch>	and wanted to know why there is a "extern" statement but no implementation
<edx|studying>	well - the impelementation is missing.
<calpefrosch>	please don't laugh ;-)
<edx|studying>	no way.. :)
<edx|studying>	the implementation is indeed missing for the firmware.. but not for the simulator
<calpefrosch>	I'm coming from the pascal ( Turbo Pascal, Delphi ) edge
<edx|studying>	i put an #ifndef SIMULATOR there
<edx|studying>	yea i did that too once ;)
<calpefrosch>	yeah, I saw that. so there are no firmware-file function?
<calpefrosch>	and java
<edx|studying>	i never did java - right, no firmware file functions
<calpefrosch>	okay.
<calpefrosch>	and the dir is also missing =
<edx|studying>	yea
<edx|studying>	even the predefinitions are missing
<edx|studying>	my file.h contained them but Zagor commited faster then i did ;)
<calpefrosch>	oh
<calpefrosch>	can I talk to you tomorrow morning til 8 ?
<edx|studying>	i gotta go to school at 7..
<edx|studying>	i might not even be online before :/
<calpefrosch>	hmm, okay. can you try to put some compiling/working code to the cvs ? 
<calpefrosch>	so I can "play" around with it ?
<edx|studying>	the code is working
<edx|studying>	you resmove the file-win32.c from the project.
<edx|studying>	the int works perfectly.
<edx|studying>	*int = it
<calpefrosch>	tnx, are you working on the file-win32.c ?
<edx|studying>	currently not...
<edx|studying>	i cannot spot the mistake *shame on me*
<calpefrosch>	he, you are 15 (right?) and a good programmer. do you want to do this as a job in future =
<calpefrosch>	?
<edx|studying>	sure.. :)
<calpefrosch>	cool
<calpefrosch>	I love this job. sometimes I cannot sleep because I'm thinking about a problem. 
<edx|studying>	hehe i have had this since I was 10 :)
<calpefrosch>	And if I get the clue, I cannot wait to get to job. I really love it.
<edx|studying>	yea
<edx|studying>	it is amazing - sometimes I get up at 5 AM just to try something :)
<calpefrosch>	yeah. Everybody calls me a "hacker", only because I'm not such a clean Projectmanager. 
<calpefrosch>	like some others.
<calpefrosch>	hehe, there are many really bad coders in the company.
<edx|studying>	hehe
<calpefrosch>	I'm just lokking at your file-win32.c
<edx|studying>	hm the c file is rather uninteresting
<edx|studying>	the file-win32.h causes the problem
<calpefrosch>	ah
<edx|studying>	typedef _finddata_t DIR;
<edx|studying>	it wont recognize _finddata_t though it is definded or something - I really have no clue.
<calpefrosch>	what means the _ before the name ?
<edx|studying>	it is just definde that way. in io.h
<edx|studying>	its not defined by me or anyone of this project. it is a standard type
<calpefrosch>	yes, I see. and what means the typedef ?
<calpefrosch>	if it's already defined ?
<calpefrosch>	I found an example in the www: struct _finddata_t FFBLK1; 
<edx|studying>	ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
<edx|studying>	THANKS
<edx|studying>	i guess you fixed it..

<edx>	hi Zagor..
<Zagor>	hi
<edx>	i have a question
<Zagor>	ok
<edx>	reagrding the directory functions:
<edx>	where do i put declaration of the functions?
<edx>	also file.h
<Zagor>	they're already in dir.h
<edx>	ah ok!
<edx>	i know what was wrong with the dir definition :)
<Zagor>	:)
<edx>	typedef struct _findfata_t DIR;
<edx>	***struct***
<Zagor>	ah
<edx>	another thing.. what parts of the dirent struct will be used?
<edx>	i saw it contains an offset to the next dirent entry (??)
<Zagor>	no, it contains the name
<edx>	and a few other thigns.
<Zagor>	it will also contain an attribyte
<Zagor>	attribute
<Zagor>	and a file size
<Zagor>	that's about all it will contain
<edx>	struct direnttag
<edx>	{
<edx>	    long            d_ino; /* inode number */
<edx>	    long            d_off; /* offset to the next dirent */
<edx>	    unsigned short  d_reclen;/* length of this record */
<edx>	    unsigned char   d_type; /* type of file */
<edx>	    char            d_name[256]; /* filename */
<edx>	};
<Zagor>	don't look at that
<Zagor>	look at dir.h
<edx>	aha
<edx>	wait a sec
<edx>	oh..
<edx>	good.. well may I put a define in there
<edx>	the DIR thing has to be different for the simulator?
<Zagor>	why?
<Zagor>	oh, ok
<edx>	what does the offset thing in the dir do?
<edx>	array index?
<Zagor>	it's implementation specific
<edx>	but i do not have to keep it for my implementation, do i?
<Zagor>	no you can #ifdef your own implementation
<edx>	i will do that in a separet header file..
<edx>	dir-win32.h
<Zagor>	ok, if you want
<edx>	then.. i need to update file.h
<Zagor>	ok, with what?
<edx>	because if you compile with the simulator, you do not need to define open close etc.. (also not with linux, right)?
<Zagor>	right
<edx>	then.. the compiler gives me an error with your current dirent definition...
<Zagor>	of course. it's the definition for the firmware, not the simulator
<edx>	is that ok:
<edx>	typedef struct {
<edx>	    int d_name[256];
<edx>	} dirent;
<edx>	the simulator does not have to change the dirent definition after all.
<edx>	(at least in windows)
<edx>	dirent *readdir (DIR *dir); <---  this will give an error otherwise (if i dont take the typedef above)
<Zagor>	so what is the problem?
<edx>	i need to replace you definition of dirent with mine ;)
<Zagor>	fine, go ahead
<Zagor>	use a file-win32.h
<edx>	extern struct dirent* readdir(DIR* dir); then you could replce this with:
<edx>	extern dirent *readdir (DIR *dir);
<edx>	or is the struct thing somehow important?
<Zagor>	yes, the API is important
<Zagor>	it must stay the same
<edx>	the struct must remain there?
<Zagor>	it's a struct called dirent. it's not a type called dirent
<edx>	tehn ill apply it to my functions as well and it wont matter.
<Zagor>	good
<Zagor>	the struct contents can change, but the function definitions must be exact
<edx>	ok.
<edx>	done.
<edx>	ill commit what i changed
<edx>	done.
<Zagor>	don't use _WIN32. use WIN32
<edx>	hmm grummel..
<Zagor>	umm you smashed my last commit...
<edx>	hm not really.
<Zagor>	no, sorry.
<edx>	i updated before i commited
<Zagor>	i saw wrong :)
<edx>	heh :)
<edx>	ok.. WIN32 instead of _WIN32
<edx>	commited.
<edx>	how can i receive mails for cvs updates?
<edx>	is there a cvs-update-mailing list lol
