---	You are now known as adi|home
<Bagder>	hey adia
<Bagder>	nice playlsit fix
<adi|home>	thanks :)
*	adi|home finally did something productive
<adi|home>	i figured 255 was a good size...
<adi|home>	8shrugs*
<Bagder>	yes, its fine
<adi|home>	OH MY GOD!
<adi|home>	rockbox.. on my recorder?!!!
*	adi|home does backflips
<Bagder>	does it rock?
<adi|home>	but the text is _very_ pale
<adi|home>	dunno yet :)
<Bagder>	hehe
<Linus>	adi|home: the paleness is interesting
<adi|home>	hmm problem thought
<Linus>	did you build it yourself
<adi|home>	no.. 
<adi|home>	its the one from the builds off the site
<adi|home>	i don't have a cross compiler yet
<Linus>	ok
<Linus>	the LCD contrast is an issue in lcd.c
<adi|home>	and interesting.. it dont play nice with the dc plugged in.
<Bagder>	Linus: its not that pale on yours is it?
<Linus>	Bagder: no
<Linus>	adi|home: "play nice"?
<adi|home>	i plug the dc in and it reboots to recharge mode
<adi|home>	i leave it in
<adi|home>	and press on, it reboots.. pauses, and jumps back to recharge mode
<Linus>	wow!
<adi|home>	?
<adi|home>	ned to increase logo display time
<Linus>	wow! as in "what the heck"
<adi|home>	i see it for like 1/10th a sec.. and its gone
<adi|home>	am i the only person that has had this happ
<Linus>	adi|home: we don't want to show the logo longer time than the setup needs
<Linus>	and right now it displays a little late
<Bagder>	Linus: why did you move the logo showing to after all the init?
<adi|home>	got ya.
<Linus>	Bagder: because it tries to load the logo from disk
<Bagder>	not anymore
<Linus>	i could have put it before the last two calls, and gained a millisecond
<Bagder>	you can have it after the lcd_init() now, can't you?
<adi|home>	okay.. off to bed for real :)
<Bagder>	night adi|home
<Linus>	Bagder: perhaps now, but not when i committed that change
<Bagder>	then too actually ;-)
<Linus>	oh maybe the commit mail was late
<Bagder>	my fix was ~40 minutes before yours ;)
<Linus>	:-)
<Linus>	Then move it up!
<Bagder>	yessir, will do!
<Bagder>	*done*
*	Zagor is now officially a counter-strike consultant :)
*	Bagder hands Zagor the "professional gamer" sticker
<dwihno>	Check the latest post in the mailing list
<Zagor>	yup, that's cool
<dwihno>	That URL should be placed on the rockbox site.
<Zagor>	hmm. the "hardware mods" page, maybe?
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	or possibly "related projects"
<dwihno>	Have you seen such a joystick earlier?
<Zagor>	yes, he has mailed about it before
<dwihno>	mkay
<dwihno>	One of those would be cute
<dwihno>	Although pretty useless without a display
<dwihno>	stop/play/pause/volume perhaps
<Zagor>	you can't have a display without hacking the archos
<dwihno>	:/
<dwihno>	well, I guess you can't have everything
<dwihno>	the official remote from archos, does it have display?
<Zagor>	no
<Zagor>	the remote control plug only has data-in (into the archos) so there is no way to transmit data back to the remote. that's why you can't have a display
<Zagor>	brb
<--	Zagor has quit ("Client Exiting")
-->	ironi (ironi@as2-5-7.j.bonet.se) has joined #rockbox
<ironi>	hi
<ironi>	Bagder: there?
<Bagder>	yah
<ironi>	im working on a small sms thingy
<ironi>	I considered using smash as server and phpsmash as client
<ironi>	is it easy to install and configure?
-->	Zagor (~bjst@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<Bagder>	never tried phpsmash
<Bagder>	smash itself is pretty easy
<Bagder>	the tricky part is if you want to tweak a plugin or something
<ironi>	wel the plugins you have links toon your page
<ironi>	don't say that they actually are plugins for smash
<Bagder>	smash uses plugins
<Zagor>	links to plugins?
<ironi>	well yeah
<ironi>	freenet and so on
<ironi>	cause that is what im aiming at
<ironi>	web-based sms services
<Zagor>	yes, the links are to external programs you can call with the "shell" smash plugin
<ironi>	ok
<ironi>	so can you specify plugin to use from the client?
<ironi>	and params to the client
<Zagor>	you can specify which operator to use. the details are defined in the server config
<ironi>	ok
<ironi>	hm
<ironi>	maybe i should use linuxsms for what I am doing
<ironi>	just rebuild it a bit
<ironi>	its not very compliated thing to do
<Zagor>	that's for you to decide :) what do you want to do?
<ironi>	Zagor: a project for my fellow siemens s45/me45 users
<ironi>	im going to make a compiled wml page that they can store in the small file archive on the phone
<ironi>	in it, they will be able to enter username, password and sms number & message
<ironi>	press send and it will send it through the server
<ironi>	just trying it out for fun...
<ironi>	which gives virtually free sms through gprs
<Zagor>	i'd recommend smash for that, since it has proper queueing. you don't want to reinvent that, trust me :)
<ironi>	why not sending messages at once?
<ironi>	Zagor: becuase of the load?
<Zagor>	to save bandwith == money
<ironi>	well
<Zagor>	also many use dialup, so you want to keep down the number of calls
<ironi>	yeah money for the users, you're right
<ironi>	keep down the number of calls...now im not following
<Zagor>	most people use GSM operators' official dial-up SMS servers
<Bagder>	but ironi isn't
<Bagder>	he doesn't necessarily need queueing
<Zagor>	i know. but it's still a good idea to queue, to avoid many parallel connections to the service
<ironi>	Zagor: for bandwidth
<ironi>	Zagor: so gsm operators have a number one can call to send sms?
<Zagor>	that, and to avoid getting blocked for over-use...
<ironi>	How expensive is that anyway
<Zagor>	mostly it's priced the same as a mobile call
<ironi>	ok
<ironi>	well
<ironi>	smash.cgf not found
<ironi>	cfg
<ironi>	hm..
<ironi>	oh.
<Zagor>	smashd --config <file>
<ironi>	i see
<ironi>	great commenting in the smash.cfg :-P
<Zagor>	it's a hackers-only file ;)
<ironi>	i put config, smash binarys and plugins in /usr/local/bin/smash
<ironi>	maybe thats politically incorrect
<ironi>	=)
<Zagor>	that's fine
<ironi>	is smashd very resource demanding?
<Bagder>	no
<ironi>	there it goes, up n running
<Zagor>	the one we have running has spend 2 cpu seconds since june 1st :)
<ironi>	hehe
<ironi>	well
<ironi>	now i need to send messages to it
<Zagor>	ironi: let's go to #smash instead. ok?
<ironi>	maybe easiest to send wml page to a php page, and from the php page sent it to the server
<Zagor>	woobiedooobie. i'm browsing files with Rockbox on my recorder
<Zagor>	the screen update is horrible slow :(
<dwihno>	:/
<Bagder>	why is that you think?
<dwihno>	vsync? :)
<Zagor>	i don't know. i just know when i scroll down, you can see the screen clear and then redraw. and you don't see that with the archos firmware
<Zagor>	and the contrast is waaaay too low
<Zagor>	but WOWSERS the logo is cool! :)
<Zagor>	in fact, it seems Rockbox actually boots faster than the original firmware.
<dwihno>	:O
<dwihno>	Zagor: cool stuff
<dwihno>	Mail the ajz to me :)
<Zagor>	http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/recorder/archos.ajz
<ironi>	now i wish i had a recorder
<dwihno>	*awating bootup*
<Zagor>	Linus: is lower value higher contrast, or the opposite?
<Linus>	I don't know. I guess higher numbers gives higher contrast
<Zagor>	testing
<Linus>	but it's not that easy
<Zagor>	no?
<Linus>	the contrast setting (according to the solomon data sheet) is an iterative process
<Zagor>	tetris ROCKS! :)
<Linus>	you have to continue setting the contrast until the status resister says it is done
<Zagor>	oh
<Linus>	register
