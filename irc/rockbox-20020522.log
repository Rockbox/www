<dwihno>	Hail to the almighty LINUS!: D
<Linus>	Yo!
<Linus>	Where did you order your Archos? And did you order a Recorder?
<dwihno>	I ordered it from Dustin
<dwihno>	Yeah, a recorder model
<dwihno>	I also ordered myself a new "dual optical" mouse from logitech ;D
<Linus>	Nice.
<dwihno>	yeah :)
<dwihno>	I just hope my expectations won't fail me ;)
<Linus>	Me too.
<adi|home>	weclome back all :)
<dwihno>	thanks
<Linus>	Hi adi!
<dwihno>	I might get it today
<dwihno>	(that is, if I'm _EXTREMELY_ lucky) ;)
<PsycoXul>	btw the archos firmware does handle being turned off somehow, because custom firmware won't turn off with the power plugged in but archos firmware will
<Linus>	Oh. That's something we'll have to look into
<dwihno>	PsycoXul: how extensivly have you been testing the new code on the actual hardware?
<PsycoXul>	well lets see i threw it on there last night and didn't past ata_init() so uh not very? :p
<Linus>	Strange, that thing with the ATA...
<Linus>	PsycoXul: have you opened your box?
<PsycoXul>	no
<Linus>	Ok.
<dwihno>	heheh
<dwihno>	Well, try to have a positive perspective - you at least got to ata_init() :)
<dwihno>	Was it the first test on actual hardware you performed last night?
<PsycoXul>	i've played with little pieces of code on the hardware a good amount
<dwihno>	cool :)

<Bagder>	hey ho
<dwihno>	Hello Bagder! :D
<Linus>	Yo Bagder!
<Bagder>	oh crap, Linus got here before me!!! :-)
<dwihno>	:D
<dwihno>	He was here REALLY early!
<dwihno>	07:38 <Linus> Yo!
<dwihno>	You can't beat that! :D
<Bagder>	hehe
<Bagder>	I'm pretty often at work before that actually
<Linus>	But then he's so tired he can't even read or speak. :-)
<Bagder>	its just a matter of coffee amounts :)
<dwihno>	Hehe
<dwihno>	The caffeine is your friend! :D
<dwihno>	<-- just had his third cup of coffee
<Linus>	Björns donated player has an old display after all
<Bagder>	ah
<Linus>	Version 4.13
<Bagder>	did you get anything displayed on it?
<Linus>	Stone dead.
<Linus>	And the 4.13 display is stone dead when I pair it with Björns old CPU board.
<dwihno>	It's stone'd ;)
<adi|home>	btw... zagor stated 'the firmware should never exit'
<adi|home>	so we #defined the uisim to use the off button...
<adi|home>	but on the player and the recorder.. does the firmware trap the off button or what?
<adi|home>	i mean how else do you turn the unit off?
*	Bagder has no clue
*	adi|home draws a target on Bagder's forehead then poke's him in the bullseye
-->	Zagor_ (~bjst@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<adi|home>	speak of the devil...
<Linus>	I think the hardware traps the off button

<Linus>	eieio
<adi|home>	like 20 secs ago
<adi|home>	and sometimes y
<Zagor>	ah
<dwihno>	YAY!
<Zagor>	well we don't know for sure
<dwihno>	My Archos is in Umeå now!
<Zagor>	the recorder seems to simply go into powersave mode and not actually turn off 100%
<dwihno>	I'm gonna get it today! :D
<dwihno>	Oh joy!
<adi|home>	really? thats just weird
<adi|home>	and the player?
*	dwihno starts bouncing around like a a playfull puppu
<dwihno>	puppy ;)
<Zagor>	i don't know. we need to do some measurements
<Linus>	I don't think it's weird that it goes into powersave mode
*	adi|home puts newspaper under dwihno
<Linus>	That way it can keep the settings in RAM
<adi|home>	no.. what i mean is.. sholdn't both units?
<adi|home>	i mean, why wouldn't the player as well?
<Linus>	i dunno
<Linus>	Maybe they designed it in a hurry
<adi|home>	keep those answers up.. and im giving you a target too...
<adi|home>	;)
<Linus>	maybe the LCD display has no powersave mode
<Linus>	who knows?
*	adi|home nods
<adi|home>	okay.. im off to bed then.. long day tomorrow.
<Zagor>	night!
<dwihno>	sweet dreams
<Linus>	COFFEEEEEE!
<dwihno>	I'm way ahead of you Linus! :) Got my 4th cup!
<adi|home>	and also.. its E.M.S. appreciation week here in the States.. so appreciate me damn it!

<adi|home>	hehehe

<adi|home>	nite agin
<Linus>	Gah!
<Linus>	The "new" display works with the "new" CPU board
<Linus>	So we night have *three* display types on our hands!
<Bagder>	hmrpmf
<Zagor>	or at least combining old new cpu with old display wasn't as simple as we thought
<Linus>	Or it might be that it has nothing to do with the LCD at all.
<Linus>	Just incompatible boards
<Linus>	But how????
<Linus>	I wonder what's different...
<Zagor>	don't worry about that too much, it's not like anyone else is going to attempt it...
<Linus>	True. I'm just curious
<Bagder>	you should still write down or post your findings, so that we have them saved for the future
<Linus>	And we still need to debug a New(tm) Player to find out what's different with the ATA interface
<Zagor>	yes

<dwihno>	I want my archos NOW!!! :)
<dwihno>	What are you people going to eat for lunch today?
<Bagder>	I think I'm up for chinese today
<dwihno>	yum
<dwihno>	noodles is always nice
<dwihno>	NASIGORENG!
<Zagor>	today is sushi day
<Zagor>	btw, guys, I managed to exchange a few words with Tumm yesterday. he exists! ;)
*	Bagder faints
<dwihno>	Eww! Sushi! That's like, dead fish!
<Linus>	Well. It's almost alive!
<dwihno>	Fried fish = yum yum
<Zagor>	barely dead :)
<Linus>	Wonderful!
<Linus>	Delicious!
<Bagder>	I wish we had a sushi place around here

<Zagor>	PsycoXul: you here?
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<Zagor>	have you opened your archos?
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	no i haven't
<Zagor>	ok. we're having a theory that perhaps your harddisk is jumpered as "slave"
<PsycoXul>	fun
<Zagor>	it's not so bad, we just have to deal with it in ata_init() if that's the case. but it's a bit tricky to find out without opening your archos... :)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	well i need to back it up [actualy mostly reorganize my HD copies to match the structure on the archos just so i can see that it really is backed up], and take it to best buy to get it serviced so they can remove the sticker and i don't have to worry about it
<PsycoXul>	i wasn't planning on opening it till after that
<Zagor>	well maybe you don't have to. we could try just patching your code a bit and see what happens
<Zagor>	stand by :)
<PsycoXul>	the power plugin does need to be resoldered or something i think, if i bump it while its plugged in it'll lose the contact
-->	Zagor_ (~bjst@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<PsycoXul>	but i can't test anything till tomorrow... gotta juggle HD's in a win98 box next to me to boot it to linux with my sh1 dev stuff and its too late tonight to be getting into that... 
<Zagor_>	:-(
<PsycoXul>	and i'm hopping in the shower now heh
<Zagor_>	when you get the chance, try changing SELECT_LBA to 0x50 in ata.c
<PsycoXul>	ok
<--	Zagor has quit (card.openprojects.net irc.openprojects.net)
---	Zagor_ is now known as Zagor
<PsycoXul>	well i'll go take a shower and if its not too late after that then maybe i can
<Bagder>	PsycoXul: where are you, geograpicly?
<Zagor>	pacbell.net hints US
<dwihno>	I GOT MY ARCHOS IN MY HAND!
<Bagder>	try the demos! ;-)
<dwihno>	hm
<dwihno>	how do I connect it? ;)
<Bagder>	to what?
<dwihno>	To the PC
<dwihno>	It just says charging
<dwihno>	no "hello USB" thingy
<Zagor>	yay, that was fast
<Linus>	dwihno: turn it on
<dwihno>	Trying
<dwihno>	It just says "charging batteries"
<Linus>	Hold ON down for a few secs
<Zagor>	dwihno: go to groups.yahoo.com and join the archosjukebox6000 group. then read the faq there, it will answer your 20 first questions :-)
<dwihno>	Help me out, I don't wanna search no mail list! :(
<Linus>	How long did you press ON?
<Zagor>	keep it down 5-10 seconds
<dwihno>	öjj, nu hände det grejer
<dwihno>	Windows won't say hello USB
<Zagor>	you need to install the driver from the cd
<Zagor>	uh, maybe not
<Zagor>	i was thinking about the old archos :)
<Zagor>	which windows do you have?
*	Bagder has glass windows ;-)
<Linus>	You do have to install a driver if you have Win98
<Zagor>	yeah, I guess we can't expect MSWindows to follow specifications... ;*)
<Bagder>	ah they do, just not the SAME specifications ;-)

<Bagder>	now, rip it up and make that serial port work for debugging B-P
<Zagor>	haha
<Linus>	hihi
<Linus>	Bagder: why don't you??? :-)
<Bagder>	well, no recorder has so far
<Bagder>	not even you guys
<Bagder>	right?
<dwihno>	hahahaha
<dwihno>	damn
<dwihno>	whoa
<Zagor>	right
<dwihno>	<-- gets a glass of water...

<dwihno>	haha
<dwihno>	:)
<dwihno>	Win2k said: "Hello USB" and installed it as a mass storage device without any extra drivers
<Zagor>	good
<Zagor>	where are our win32 developers? it's been awfully quiet lately
<PsycoXul>	back
<dwihno>	Whoa
<dwihno>	whoa whoa whoa
<PsycoXul>	yeah i'm in the US, california
<dwihno>	Oh my god
<Bagder>	Zagor: indeed, the win32 simulator is now lagging behind
<PsycoXul>	bah
<PsycoXul>	win32 people aren't *real* developers anyways :p
<Bagder>	hehe
<Zagor>	adiamas spilled the beans in the yahoo forum a couple of days ago and now everyone is very interested. a win32 simulator would be good soon
<Bagder>	hey!
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<Bagder>	we're now 101 subscribers
<Bagder>	on the rockbox list
<Zagor>	and <1 msg/day :-)
<Bagder>	yeah
<dwihno>	*copy files*
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: can you test now?
<dwihno>	The speed is quite alright for being a USB 1.1 computer I'm using
<Bagder>	dwihno: hehe that'll keep you busy for a while
<Linus>	dwihno: do you have USB2.0 on your computer?
<Linus>	ah
<dwihno>	Getting files from work -> home will never be a problem again ;)
<Bagder>	sure it will, you won't have room for with all those mp3s on it ;-)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<dwihno>	hehe
<PsycoXul>	Zagor: just booted over
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: meaning?
<PsycoXul>	you know i think most of the problems i have with this thing over USB is due to trying it when the batteries low
<Zagor>	yeah that's a bad idea
<PsycoXul>	Zagor: meaning i'm copying the test file now
<Zagor>	ok
<PsycoXul>	well
<PsycoXul>	usualy when i plug it in the batteries like half way
<PsycoXul>	to USB i mean
<PsycoXul>	and then i copy files and after several times in one session it starts having problems
<PsycoXul>	using it as a USB HD seems to eat the batteries really quick
<PsycoXul>	hmmm
<Zagor>	yeah, always keep the power cable connected in usb mode
<PsycoXul>	like now the batteries shouldn't be very low but it may have stalled on the copy already
<dwihno>	For how many hours do the batteries last?
<dwihno>	10 hours?
<Zagor>	roughly, yes
<dwihno>	mkay
<PsycoXul>	i estimate 5-10 hours depending bitrate, settings, volume, how much you mess with it
<dwihno>	mess?
<PsycoXul>	if you press buttons a lot
<dwihno>	you mean, use it as a USB harddrive?
<PsycoXul>	have the backlight on much
<PsycoXul>	etc
<PsycoXul>	dwihno: yeah
<PsycoXul>	er
<PsycoXul>	no
<dwihno>	amongst other things
<PsycoXul>	dwihno: i mean if you set up a 10 hour playlist, start it, stick it in your pouch/pocket and then don't touch it till it goes dead
<PsycoXul>	dwihno: it'll last a long longer than if you play some songs, then browse around and play some more, etc
<dwihno>	mkay
<dwihno>	Will the unit start to fux0r if I change the hard disk label?
<PsycoXul>	nah
<PsycoXul>	one of the first things i did :p
<dwihno>	heh
<dwihno>	insanity! is the label now
<dwihno>	:)
<dwihno>	20 gigs of music in your pocket is nothing but pure insanity
<PsycoXul>	yep
<PsycoXul>	its true
<PsycoXul>	just wait
<PsycoXul>	its like your life suddenly got a soundtrack :p
<dwihno>	:)
<dwihno>	Oh my fucking G.O.D!
<Zagor>	dwihno: 20 gigs? bah, 40 here. and there's 60 gig disks out now.
<dwihno>	whoa
<dwihno>	Zagor: suck my dick :)
<Zagor>	no thanks :)
<PsycoXul>	heh
<dwihno>	I'll sync it against my collection at home tonight
<PsycoXul>	ok
<PsycoXul>	Zagor: no change
<Zagor>	hmm
<Linus>	PsycoXul: you mean the ATA slave test?
<Zagor>	yes
<Linus>	bah!
<Zagor>	hmm, we must do a device select before we start polling status...
<Linus>	Dont we do that now?
<Zagor>	nopp
<Linus>	But the ATA interface must be initialized already?
<Zagor>	i'll try and adapt the master/slave check code I have in the isd200 driver...
<Zagor>	hmm, you're right
<Zagor>	still, it just doesn't work
<dwihno>	Whoa
<dwihno>	I wanna go hoooome! :)
<dwihno>	Listen to music! :)
<dwihno>	I love the audio quality
<Zagor>	have you been able to hear the buzz yet=
<Zagor>	?
<dwihno>	Didn't try
<PsycoXul>	i get a buzz while my studio20's charging sometimes... it comes and goes and when it comes i can't get rid of it and when it goes i can't make it do it, but its from the unit itself and not the headphones heh
<Zagor>	oh
<Zagor>	are you using the stock charger?
<PsycoXul>	yes
<Zagor>	it could be voltage related
<PsycoXul>	its no big deal and i only get it sometimes
<dwihno>	I'll try to get the buzz tonight
<dwihno>	Damn
<dwihno>	The bass is exquisite!
<dwihno>	My EXP101 is WAY out!
<Zagor>	dwihno: you can probably "force" the buzz by only inserting the headphone plug half-way
<Zagor>	still, if you can't hear it why look for it :)
<dwihno>	hehe
<dwihno>	true, true
<dwihno>	You will not find the force, the force will find you!
<dwihno>	Reverse that sentence and imagine Yoda saying it ;)
<PsycoXul>	find the force you will not, find you it will
<dwihno>	:)
<dwihno>	:-)
*	dwihno sighs
<PsycoXul>	but yeah
<PsycoXul>	anything else i should try today?
<dwihno>	How long time does it take to charge it?
<Zagor>	dwihno: a long time. leave it overnight at least
<Zagor>	it handles it intelligently, so there's no problem leaving it too long
<dwihno>	Ah, sure
<PsycoXul>	yeah but don't leave it too too long especialy if you use the stock adapter
<dwihno>	How come?
<PsycoXul>	cause its an unregulated piece of shit adapter that i guess provides more power than the unit needs to start with, and especialy once its charged, that extra power gets put out as heat
<PsycoXul>	some people have damaged their units with that
<PsycoXul>	mine's gotten hotten than i'm comfortable with a couple times
<PsycoXul>	hotter
<dwihno>	ah
<dwihno>	does it tell when the charging is finished?
<Zagor>	yes
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<dwihno>	and how many hours does a typical charge take?
<dwihno>	the green led goes blank when it's fully charged?
<Zagor>	no the display says "Charging complete"
<Zagor>	the green led is hardwired to power-on
<PsycoXul>	i dunno about recorders, but my player says "charged" instead of "charging..." and you can also hear the HD spin up
<Zagor>	the recorder does not spin the hd
<PsycoXul>	huh
<Zagor>	the "charging complete, let's dissipate excess power via spinning hd" seems to be a new-players-only thing
<dwihno>	mkay
<dwihno>	Should I upgrade to the newsest firmware?
<Zagor>	which version do you have?
<dwihno>	lemme check... where do I do that?
<Zagor>	menu->firmware
<Bagder>	who cares about firmware versions, we need rockbox ;-)
<dwihno>	hehe
<dwihno>	rockbox is still just a dream
<dwihno>	Rockbox - Because dreams will come true!
<dwihno>	There's a slogan you can use ;)
<PsycoXul>	you know it *seriously* seems like the players firmware was a hacked together bare minimal with a few things thrown in cause they were easy, and i *swear* they anticipated a project to replace it 
<PsycoXul>	to me anyways :p
<dwihno>	you might be right
<Zagor>	i doubt they anticipated anyone replacing it. then why would the scramble it? I agree on the "hacked together" part, though
<dwihno>	ask the firmware developers
<PsycoXul>	i couldn't tell you why they scramble it
<PsycoXul>	it doesn't seem to actualy accomplish anything anyways :p
<Zagor>	it would appear they explicity wanted something like this to never happen...
<dwihno>	1.26
<dwihno>	mar 10 2002
<dwihno>	that's the firmware
<Zagor>	dwihno: I think there's a 1.27 out. try it if you feel like it.
<Zagor>	I'm using 1.24. can't be bother with their mini changes
*	Bagder has 1.25b
<PsycoXul>	so you guys got anything else for me to test today or can i throw the normal firmware on there and call it a day? heh
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: we're done for now, I think. i'll test some stuff on my end first.
<PsycoXul>	ok
<Bagder>	there's a 1.27c available
<dwihno>	Where do you find the firmware?
<dwihno>	I'm trying to find, but can't!
<Bagder>	http://www.archos.com/us/download_drivers.html
<dwihno>	ah
<dwihno>	thanks
<Bagder>	"archos recorder firmware" on google showed that as first choice
<Bagder>	the rockbox link was only on third place ;-)
<dwihno>	Yeah! :D
<PsycoXul>	ok
<PsycoXul>	i descrambled/hexedited/rescrambled the archos firmware and changed 'CHARGE' to 'FUX0RZ' and 'CHARGING' to 'FUX0RING' etc
<Zagor>	haha
<PsycoXul>	and put it on, booted it, shut it off, plugged it in just to see
<PsycoXul>	and it still says CHARGE, CHARGING
<dwihno>	:)
<dwihno>	hm
<PsycoXul>	so apparently firmware upgrades don't effect its charging stuff
<dwihno>	stupid :/
<Zagor>	ah, no. not unless you first start the firmware then plug in the charger
<PsycoXul>	which makes sense to me since it doesn't boot up from the HD to charge
<dwihno>	In what way is the firmware scrambled? :) XOR?
<Zagor>	no it's a bit more than that
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Zagor>	they used the old "swap bus pins" trick, only in software instead of hardware
<dwihno>	(?)
<dwihno>	swap bus pins?
<PsycoXul>	ok so i turned it on and plugged it in and then turned it off and it still says CHARGE heh
<PsycoXul>	they seem to have a lot of unused stuff in their firmware upgrades
<Zagor>	don't turn it off
<Zagor>	when you turn it off it reverts to rom
<PsycoXul>	well when its on it just displays the normal interface and the battery indicator just moves
<Zagor>	dwihno: yeah, if you swap the bus pins to the ROM, the contents of the ROM becomes scrambled without you actually having to unscramble it
<dwihno>	Femton pirater å en flaska mä rooooom! :D
<PsycoXul>	so i'll never see those messages heh
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: ah, silly me
<dwihno>	Zagor: mkay
<dwihno>	Zagor: in quiet parts of the songs, I hear a faint buzz noise...
<dwihno>	I can live with it though
<PsycoXul>	i was mainly just wondering how "fixed battery charged issue" ended up on the feature list of a firmware upgrade... so now we know just cause they say they added it doesn't necessarily mean it'll have any effect for an upgrade :p
<Zagor>	i guess you're right
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: umm, feel like testing some more? ;)
*	Zagor ducks
<dwihno>	What's with that digital serial thing? Are they trying to disable something?
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Zagor>	dwihno: what do you mean?
<PsycoXul>	sure, except i just booted that box back to win98 so i can't compile anything for it heh
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: if i select slave, I get the same 00 status response as you get
<Zagor>	so we should probably we checking master/slave the first thing we do
<dwihno>	Zagor: Well, I read something about some serial thing and DMCA... And the link said something about making digital copies... I thought they might be trying to disable digital copying...
<PsycoXul>	ok
<PsycoXul>	hey its kindof funny
<PsycoXul>	i've got this song called 'descramble' 
<PsycoXul>	its the DeCSS source code, sang
<Zagor>	dwihno: ah, yes. like everyone selling stuff in the US they must obey silly rules. but there are ways around the SCMS. (it's in the FAQ ;)
<Zagor>	dwihno: but it's only over the SPDIF interface anyway. and nobody uses that
<PsycoXul>	with the chorus "the dmca steps me... i don't like the dmca, it makes this song illegal" 
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: lol
<dwihno>	:)
<PsycoXul>	er "steps on me"
<PsycoXul>	its bad recording, bad quality, bad performance but its kinda catchy :p
<Zagor>	i like the lyrics...
*	Bagder thinks songs by "decoded feedback" kind of fits on mp3
<PsycoXul>	how can you not love a song that starts off with
<PsycoXul>	"this function is void.. it takes to args"
<dwihno>	Zagor: Nothing about SCMS in the FAQ :/
<PsycoXul>	:p
<Bagder>	hehehe
<PsycoXul>	s/to/two/
<dwihno>	:-)
<PsycoXul>	DMCA steps on me... i don't like the dmca it makes this song illegal, oooh... dmca, it steps on me and makes this song illegal, makes this song illegal
<dwihno>	PsycoXul: You need coffee.
<PsycoXul>	eye dew gnot.
*	dwihno hands PsycoXul a steaming hot cup dé coffee
*	PsycoXul hands it back, thanks anyways heh
<PsycoXul>	coffee's nasty stuff man :p
<PsycoXul>	and it pisses me off that innocent pot smokers are going to jail while everyone from gradeschoolers to their parents are hooked on caffiene :p
<dwihno>	hehe
<Linus>	Gotta go. Bye folks!
<dwihno>	You haven't made a 'scroll faster' patch yet? :)
<Bagder>	bye Linus
<PsycoXul>	nobody's doing patches :p
<PsycoXul>	besides maybe archos heh
<--	Linus (~linus@labb.contactor.se) has left #rockbox
<dwihno>	hehe
<dwihno>	I'll do my own patch ;D
<PsycoXul>	sure
<PsycoXul>	while you're at it, whip up some DSP code for PCM and ogg support
<PsycoXul>	so i saw this new portable thing out 
<PsycoXul>	with 10G
<PsycoXul>	can play mp3/wav but thats only a feature
<PsycoXul>	works as usb master and slave, has ethernet and pc card
<Zagor>	so what "thing" is it?
<Bagder>	gotta run, see ya
<--	Bagder (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has left #rockbox
<Zagor>	bye
<Zagor>	gah, too late :)
<PsycoXul>	http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/gadgets/57a3.shtml
<PsycoXul>	that thing
<dwihno>	it's rather sexy
<dwihno>	but it's not an archos
<dwihno>	archos is godsent!
<Zagor>	ah, a harddisk with a display. how cute :)
<dwihno>	rockbox is the archangel, sent to thame the archos!
<PsycoXul>	its size is kindof odd
<PsycoXul>	7"x3.2"x1"
<Zagor>	the price is, ehm, high
<PsycoXul>	yeah
-->	alkorr (alkorr@srs04m-8-122.n.club-internet.fr) has joined #rockbox
<Zagor>	hey, alan!
<alkorr>	hello people
<PsycoXul>	its LCD sounds like its charcell too... says 20 chars x 4 lines
<alkorr>	you are fast :)
<Zagor>	like lightning :)
<alkorr>	speaking about your project :)
<PsycoXul>	but its got some interesting features
<PsycoXul>	such as ability to use alkaline, ni-mh, or a li-ion battery pack
<alkorr>	Psyco, what are you speaking about ?
<PsycoXul>	can act as a usb master, has 10mb ethernet, pcmcia, and composite video out for viewing still images
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	alkorr: http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/gadgets/57a3.shtml
<PsycoXul>	terapin mine
<PsycoXul>	its rather long at 7" though, "20 char x 4 line" lcd doesn't sound impressive, nor does 6 buttons, and costing so much for only 10G 
<alkorr>	looks very interesting if it was not its price
<Zagor>	ga-zing-ga. file browser running on my 6k.
<PsycoXul>	what'd be more interesting is if they sold them cheap without HD's
<Zagor>	yeah, it's kind of a mix between an archos and a handheld. not being especially good for either
<PsycoXul>	but being that its geared towards being a data storage device, they probably wouldn't do that heh
<alkorr>	well I prefer a graphical lcd
<Zagor>	unghh... sourceforge's CVS server seems to have bonked
<alkorr>	???
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<alkorr>	bonked ? what does mean ?
<Zagor>	it doesn't respond right now
<Zagor>	bonked = died, sort of
<alkorr>	ok
<Zagor>	apparently it didn't like my latest patch :)
<PsycoXul>	i feel like i got shortchanged on this little 11x2 charcell thing, i've seen $10 games at walmart with better displays heh
<Zagor>	hehe
<alkorr>	arf
<Zagor>	ah, it's up again
<PsycoXul>	but at least it does display stuff
<PsycoXul>	there's so many players on the market that don't even have standard mp3 player features
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: is yours a studio 10 or 20?
<PsycoXul>	studio20
<PsycoXul>	http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/gadgets/5a1a.shtml
<Zagor>	ok
<Zagor>	hey, it can almost fit the rockbox logo! ;)
<PsycoXul>	hey thats kinda interesting... if you hooked an IR port into the serial port on your archos with custom firmware and then used that
<PsycoXul>	get a joystick and mini keyboard and extra display 
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Zagor>	yep. there's lots of cool stuff to be done on the archos
<alkorr>	hum... interesting...
<dwihno>	:)
*	dwihno takes everybody down to earth again
<dwihno>	:)
<alkorr>	you dreamreaper :)
<Zagor>	who'll be first with a keyboard->archos adapter? :)
---	dwihno is now known as DreamReaper
<DreamReaper>	Mohahaha!
<DreamReaper>	The Archos will NEVER be more than a music box! :D
<DreamReaper>	*evil laughter*
---	DreamReaper is now known as dwihno
<Zagor>	you forgot tetris :)
<alkorr>	a PC keyboard should not be a problem
<dwihno>	haha
<dwihno>	Tetris is a toy for kids :)
<PsycoXul>	Zagor: i keep thinking of a bi-directional IR via serial port
<alkorr>	if your archos has the external serial line
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: yeah, unfortunately bidir requires hw mod
<PsycoXul>	yeah i know
<PsycoXul>	i do plan on making hw mods eventualy
<dwihno>	hm
<dwihno>	bettery charged
<dwihno>	So it's full now, eh?
<alkorr>	please, consider my idea
<PsycoXul>	which idea is that
<alkorr>	there is the Linus' serial tool that we can connect between an archos and PC
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<alkorr>	if we have a PS/2<->serial adaptor
<alkorr>	it should be virtually possible to connect a PC keyboard
<PsycoXul>	heh
<alkorr>	no ?
<alkorr>	a PC keyboard sends 1200 baud, no parity, 8 bit, 1 start, 1 stop 
<alkorr>	am i wrong ?
<--	Zagor has quit (card.openprojects.net irc.openprojects.net)
<alkorr>	so jukebox should be able to receive scancodes and handles it 
-->	Zagor (~bjst@labb.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<PsycoXul>	i've got 3 ps/2-serial adapters, but all 3 are made to plug into a serial port
<PsycoXul>	and linus' serial adapter i'm guessing is also made to plug into a serial port 
<alkorr>	jukebox has no PC serial plug
<Zagor>	ah, hi again :)
<alkorr>	you need to have an intermediate
<PsycoXul>	i know
<PsycoXul>	thats what linus' adapter does right?
<PsycoXul>	heh
<dwihno>	<-- is off - no more "work" today ;D
---	dwihno is now known as dw|off
<alkorr>	yeah
<alkorr>	ah okay youre speaking about adapter
<PsycoXul>	yeah the rs232 converter
<Zagor>	then you just need the serial->archos adapter from the web page
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: yup
<PsycoXul>	which kind of rs232 port does that have? the kind like is on the computer on the kind like plugs into the computer? heh
<Zagor>	it's db9 -> 3.5mm plug
<PsycoXul>	i seem to recall somebody at some point saying they'd put pictures up of the thing
<Zagor>	dumdidum, that was never me was it? :*)
<PsycoXul>	Zagor: yes but i mean does it plug into the host port or do you plug a serial cable between the host port and the converter port or what?
<PsycoXul>	Zagor: can you plug a serial device into it
<PsycoXul>	or is it itself a serial device to be plugged in
<Zagor>	it plugs into the PC and into the archos
<PsycoXul>	i mean on the pc side
<PsycoXul>	does it have the 9 pins or the 9 holes? heh
<alkorr>	a stand serial wire
<alkorr>	standard
<alkorr>	wire between PC and adapter is female
<alkorr>	unless Linus inverted it
<PsycoXul>	so the rs232 converter's PC-style port is just like what you have on the back of your PC? heh
<alkorr>	well if not the good one, just buy a male-female adapter :)
<PsycoXul>	thats all i was wondering heh
<alkorr>	on the pc, it is a male
<alkorr>	my adapter has also a male adapter
<alkorr>	huh it is like PC one
<PsycoXul>	so if you had a serial keyboard you could plug it right into the rs232 converter?
<alkorr>	let me find another keyboard here...
<PsycoXul>	i've got 3 ps2->serial adapters heh
<alkorr>	you should because i bought a 1 ps2->serial too
<alkorr>	and it fits with my serial adapter for jukebox
<PsycoXul>	ok
<PsycoXul>	so it should be easy to hook a lot of stuff up to this sucker
*	PsycoXul pictures a little 1-pixel mouse cursor drawn in a dynamically-updated custom char on his player :p
<PsycoXul>	ok so for this thing
<PsycoXul>	i see on national.com the LP2980IM5
<PsycoXul>	they have -2.5 through -5.0
<PsycoXul>	(i.e. LP2980IM5-2.5, ..., LP2980IM5-5.0)
<Zagor>	i have to go. see you guys!
<PsycoXul>	is that the output voltage or something?
<--	Zagor (~bjst@labb.contactor.se) has left #rockbox
<PsycoXul>	do i want the -3.3 then?
<PsycoXul>	heh
