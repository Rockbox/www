<Zagor>	but why after button and mpeg init etc?
<Zagor>	it sort of defies the purpose to display the startup screen *after* startup...
---	You are now known as adi|home
<adi|home>	well that was interesting
<Linus>	Zagor: i didn't bother at the time.
-->	g003y (~foo@m198-187.dsl.rawbw.com) has joined #rockbox
<Zagor>	yeah, openprojects seems very flaky at the moment
<adi|home>	btw... im beat.. can someone take a look at the scroll stuff?
<adi|home>	its buggy
<Zagor>	adi|home: what's the problem?
<Linus>	Bagder promised to remove the disk loading, and before that i just put it last
<adi|home>	i hav chars remaining on the screen after the scroll goes by
<Linus>	adi|home: yes it bugs
<adi|home>	zag... make a file of say 4 chars
<Zagor>	on last line, or all lines?
<adi|home>	foo.mp3
<adi|home>	and let it scroll
<adi|home>	oh.. i just submitted a playlist.c fix
<Linus>	it tries to scroll file names that are shorter than the screen width
<Linus>	and fails
<adi|home>	now we read in the file 255 bytes at a time
<adi|home>	hmm... leave it.. ill take a look tomorrow night
<Zagor>	ah, yes it does. my fault, fixing...
<adi|home>	you got it zag?
<Zagor>	yep, will fix
<adi|home>	k
<adi|home>	and i tested my playlist fix.. but im beat.. so if someone else could take a look as well, id appreciated it...
<adi|home>	night all
---	You are now known as adi|sleep
<Zagor>	night!
<Hadaka>	hmh, I must agree that this 1.27something firmware is kind of even suckier than 1.24
<Zagor>	:)
<dwihno>	I think the scrolling part should have been fixed several versions ago... Sometimes the directory names I previously browsed are shown
<Zagor>	is it fixed in 1.27 then?
<dwihno>	no :)
<Zagor>	hehe
<dwihno>	and the screen garbage haven't been fixed either
<dwihno>	is there any screen garbage with rockbox?
<adi|sleep>	ok.. im back
<adi|sleep>	and pissed
<adi|sleep>	i cant get my damn archos mounted
<adi|sleep>	and i dunno hy
<adi|sleep>	why
<Zagor>	dwihno: there was, until i just fixed it :)
<Zagor>	adi|sleep: that sucks :(
<adi|sleep>	i don't remember changing anything
<adi|sleep>	i turn unit on
<adi|sleep>	i plug in..
<adi|sleep>	i go to mount
<adi|sleep>	and i keep getting that sda1 is not a valid block device
<dwihno>	Zagor: Whoa.... I am really looking forward to the mp3-decoding capable rockbox :D
*	adi|sleep pouts
<Zagor>	adi|sleep: try removing and re-modprobing usb-storage.
<Zagor>	sometimes it seems to get confused
<Linus>	dwihno: the rockbox is already mp3-decoding
<Zagor>	Linus: dwihno has a recorder...
<Linus>	oh
-->	PsycoXul (psyco@adsl-63-205-43-243.dsl.lsan03.pacbell.net) has joined #rockbox
<Linus>	hi psycho!
<PsycoXul>	hi linhus
<adi|sleep>	cant locate module usb-storage?
<dwihno>	Linus: that should explain my curiosity regarding the tech specs of the recorder chip ;)
<Zagor>	adi|sleep: maybe you didn't compile it as a module?
<adi|sleep>	what i don't get is that it was working last week, and i haven't changed anything
<adi|sleep>	really
<adi|sleep>	odd
<adi|sleep>	how can i check if it was compile as a module?
<Zagor>	run 'lsmod'. if it doesn't show up, it's not a module
<adi|sleep>	k
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	lsmod just shows loaded modules
<Linus>	dwihno: did you ask me about the recorder chip? I must have missed that in the splitting frenzy.
<adi|sleep>	k.. its not loaded
<PsycoXul>	find  /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name 'usb-storage.o'
<adi|sleep>	any other ideas PsycoXul?
<dwihno>	Linus: Nah, I was just curious if you started working on the mp3 decoding on the recorder, and you replied you had a look in the tech docs.
<adi|sleep>	nothing :)
<Linus>	ah
<PsycoXul>	well whatever modules you have should be in /lib/modules/<kernel-ver>/* 
<adi|sleep>	k
<adi|sleep>	ill be back
