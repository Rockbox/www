<Bagder>	gooood morning
<dwihno>	Hej hej

<adiamas>	anyone else play with the simulator lately?
<Bagder>	I made it build yesterday
<Bagder>	`problems?
<adiamas>	yeah.. the dir listing looks weird...
<adiamas>	misplacement of icons .. etc..
<adiamas>	bah.. don't worry.. ill get it tomorrow night.. i need sleep
*	adiamas waves
<Bagder>	hm, I believe Björn was messing in that code yesterday

<Zagor>	hey boys
<Bagder>	morning
<Bagder>	adiamas says you broke the dir browser on the recorder
<Bagder>	well, he didn't say you did it, he says its broken
<Zagor>	yes, i might have. didn't have time to test it much yesterday
<Bagder>	the daily build worked fine this morning
<Zagor>	nice
<Bagder>	in a few days, I'll set up a find job too that'll erase all files older than X days
<Zagor>	linus got a nice idea yesterday. how much work is it to get a CVS report listing all change comments between builds?
<Bagder>	I'll have a look
<Bagder>	should be a cvs log output with a time interval
<Zagor>	it would be a good automated changelog
<Bagder>	there's a cvs2changelog script somewhere 
<Bagder>	cvs log -d "2002-05-28 06:00<2002-05-29 06:00"
<Bagder>	seems to work
<Bagder>	just needs some decent parsing
<Bagder>	parsing in progress
<dwihno>	Yay! :D
<dwihno>	The power of parse compels you!
<Zagor>	when the disk is spinning, the 6k uses 240mA
<Bagder>	isn't that ~70mA more?
<Zagor>	this means idle disk spins are not that expensive
<Zagor>	exactly
<webmind>	hm
<webmind>	question: u people know if its normal that the battery does not last for 8 hours after first use :)
<Zagor>	yes it's normal. the batteries take a few charges to get full effect
<Zagor>	also the first use tends to involve a lot of keypresses :)
<webmind>	a few charges ?
<webmind>	hmk
<webmind>	heh :)
