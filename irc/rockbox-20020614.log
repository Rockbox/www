<stile>	after much thought and decision making.. ive decided.. ppl in general.. suck :)
<Bagder>	you didn't already know? ;-)
<--	adi|home has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
<stile>	i just dind't know they sucked so bad
---	You are now known as adi|home
<Bagder>	"just one more time, for the sake of sanity... tell me why, explain the gravity"
*	Bagder sings along
*	g003y wonders what song bagder is singing, and how is co-worker's feel about his voice
<Bagder>	I play so loud in my headphones I can't hear them anyway ;-)
<g003y>	hahahahaha
<Bagder>	and the song is an Assemblage 23 one
*	Bagder doesn't expect anyone to know it
<g003y>	4 on the floor techno?
<Bagder>	I wouldn't call it techno, but rather dark and hard synth/industrial
<g003y>	ahhh... thats different.  I'm talking the shit you hear in clubs that sounds like one big freaking record the dj never changes :D
<Bagder>	ah, nah, I'm not into that kind
<g003y>	thats good :D
<g003y>	is there a key combo with the current firmware build that lets you get back to the currently playing song display?
<Bagder>	I dunno
<Bagder>	heck, I hardly know how to use it at all ;-)
<g003y>	hmmm.. I don't see one in the code so I'll assume no.
<g003y>	:D
<Bagder>	I want my rockbox
<dwihno>	:D
<dwihno>	I want rockbox for recorder! :D
<dwihno>	But I'm patient
<dwihno>	So I'll just wait
<dwihno>	And contribute to the project in every way I may :)
<Bagder>	the day there's sound from the MAS3587, I'll run Rockbox non-stop
<dwihno>	MAS3587? The chip in R20?
<Bagder>	yeah
<dwihno>	mkay
<g003y>	ahhh... I'm running my own personal build of rockbox right now :D
<Bagder>	that's the spirit!
<dwihno>	Yeah, playlist parsing, LCD flickering and a couple of other things and I'll use it too
<Bagder>	it ain't cool if you didn't build it yourself ;-)
<g003y>	I saw some cvs comments about playlist parsing support
<g003y>	so I suspect that is nearing completion
<g003y>	or useable 
<Bagder>	the code is already there actually
<g003y>	ahh good deal
<Bagder>	just not shuffle
<g003y>	fair enough
<Bagder>	it "should" work now
<g003y>	I haven't loaded any yet
<dwihno>	Bagder: any limitations? I mean, does it parse m3u's with #-style comments?
<g003y>	been awhile since I've used playlists to be honest
<Bagder>	me neither, I have a recorder ;-)
<Bagder>	dwihno: no comments, no
<Bagder>	do regular m3us have them?
<g003y>	those are bastard m3us that nullsoft made the switch too.
<Bagder>	well, ignoring lines like that would be dead simple to add
<dwihno>	Bagder: Winamp store song information (length) every other line...
<Bagder>	oh
<g003y>	yeah
<g003y>	sometimes I really hate the way they do things.
<dwihno>	Is there a battery meter available yet? :)
<g003y>	nope :(
<dwihno>	The scroller is way cool btw... Should be seamless though
<Bagder>	that's a whole can of worms as they say
<g003y>	yeah I got the scroller api displaying the filename across the screen
<g003y>	at least until you dump out of that mode back to the browse mode :D
<dwihno>	:-)
<Bagder>	cool
<g003y>	I almost think ppl should be able to select/build in code for parsing their style mp3 naming, but that might be a beast nobody wants to cut loose
<Bagder>	I'm gonna take a stab at that soonish
<Bagder>	shortening the names on screen
<dwihno>	hmm
<g003y>	hmmm
<g003y>	we should share notes :D
<Bagder>	yeah
<dwihno>	I always name mine XX. YYYYYYYYY (ZZZZ).mp3
<dwihno>	X = track number
<dwihno>	Y = file name
<dwihno>	Z = remix notes
<dwihno>	Artist - Album (Year)
<dwihno>	That's how I name the dirs
<g003y>	I think that is fairly common
<g003y>	it could be just a small handful defintions of formats that ppl could choose from with a sensible default just in case.
<dwihno>	Does the current rockbox have any way of showing song length information?
<dwihno>	Compared to the archos firmware, that is
<Bagder>	it estimates the length for non VBRs
<Bagder>	that's all so far
<g003y>	estimates based on header info correct?
<Bagder>	yeps
<g003y>	but isn't that pretty much exact?
<Bagder>	it is
<Bagder>	should be at least
<g003y>	ahhh...
<g003y>	gotcha
<Bagder>	it uses integer math too which might make it loose some precision
<Bagder>	I haven't checked that closely
<g003y>	you're probably right
<g003y>	whats the problem with time display on vbrs?
<Bagder>	we need to read the whole file to get the length
<Bagder>	and it kind of sucks
<dwihno>	Is there a quick way to do VBR estimation?
<dwihno>	erhm
<g003y>	I'd say that sucks
<dwihno>	that is sucky
<g003y>	I did not realize vbr sucked that way
<dwihno>	As long as CBR's are OK ;)
<g003y>	ha....
<g003y>	I'm torn between CBR and VBRs with r3mix options on lame.
<dwihno>	Hey, what is displayed when songs are played?
<g003y>	id3 info with the current cvs tree
<g003y>	               lcd_puts(0, 0, mp3.artist?mp3.artist:"<no artist>");
<g003y>	               lcd_puts(0, 1, mp3.title?mp3.title:"<no title>");
<g003y>	there ya go :D
<dwihno>	oww
<dwihno>	Doesn't it handle non-tagged files?! :(
<Bagder>	you mean id3 info without id3? ;-)
<dwihno>	hehehe
<g003y>	hehehehehehehe
<dwihno>	mr. funny-ass pants ;)
<g003y>	I've got alternatives going on my local copy
<g003y>	so I'm sure it will be handled eventually
<g003y>	at least before the recorder version comes out :D
<dwihno>	cool
<Bagder>	haha
*	Bagder puts the "in charge of the while-playing-song display" sticker on g003y
<g003y>	gagagagagagagagagag
<g003y>	hey that isn't coming off!
<g003y>	only problem is I don't have everything quite setup right here.  I need to get an account and a real cvs login for the project
<Bagder>	mail your sf account user name to Björn
<g003y>	I will though... I'd really like to contribute my code
<g003y>	oh... I've got to get an sf account as well :D
<Bagder>	you can always start with mailing diffs
<g003y>	tru
<g003y>	e
<g003y>	I've just been syncing anon and patching my changes
<g003y>	it's not much so far, but I should get setup properly
<g003y>	I still can't believe how advanced the apis on the firmware are already
<Bagder>	it's pretty cool indeed
<g003y>	alrighty guys.  like Bagder I have to code boring stuff in a few hours at my day job.  So I think some sleep is in order for me.
<Bagder>	night g003y
<g003y>	night
<--	g003y (~foo@m198-187.dsl.rawbw.com) has left #rockbox
<Bagder>	it seems as if Zagor has problems with the new hardware... it should've been up by now

<dwihno>	:)
<Bagder>	its the new hardware that the rockbox site runs on
<dwihno>	cool stuff
<dwihno>	who pays the hw?
<Bagder>	Contactor
<Bagder>	the company I, Björn and Linus work for
<dwihno>	Hire me :)
<dwihno>	<Bagder> sure
<dwihno>	Yay ;D
<Bagder>	hehe
<dwihno>	Why not? :)
<Bagder>	I wish we could, but the market is a bit rough atm
<dwihno>	I know
<dwihno>	Are your employers aware of you spending a lot of time on the Rockbox project?
<Bagder>	no :-)
<Bagder>	I won't tell them
<Bagder>	but then I must do my proper work properly anyway
<dwihno>	Yeah
<dwihno>	My recorder sometimes skips the initial 200 msecs of a song...
<Bagder>	exactly 200?
<dwihno>	Roughly
<dwihno>	(with the stock firmware, that is)
<dwihno>	Do you experience that on the player models?
<dwihno>	(w, w/o rockbox)
<Bagder>	no idea
-->	Zagor (~bjst@mimas.contactor.se) has joined #rockbox
<Bagder>	hey ho
<Zagor>	hi. back at last
<dwihno>	10:04 < Zagor> see you soon
<dwihno>	;)
<Zagor>	yeah, well that's pc hardware for you...
<Zagor>	the motherboard has two IDE LED connectors
<Zagor>	if you connect the "wrong" one, the keyboard stops working...
<Zagor>	that one took me a while to figure out...
<dwihno>	Intel inside, Zagor outside
<Zagor>	so, what have you guys been up to this morning?
<dwihno>	We've been talking about how rockbox handles tags when the files do not have id3 tags :)
<Bagder>	g00ey was around and told us he's done some improvements on the software for what to show while a track is playing
<Bagder>	g003y
<Zagor>	ok, did we get the code?
<dwihno>	And I thought the scroller would be seamless
<Zagor>	seamless?
<Bagder>	Zagor: no, but he'll return
<Zagor>	dwihno: what do you mean seamless?
<dwihno>	I'll show
<dwihno>	Zagor had a little lamb.mp3
<dwihno>	or had a little lamb.mp3
<dwihno>	a little lamb.mp3
<dwihno>	lamb.mp3
<dwihno>	This is how it is now
<dwihno>	Zagor had a little lamb.mp3
<dwihno>	or had a little lamb.mp3
<Zagor>	not any more
<dwihno>	a little lamb.mp3    Zagor
<dwihno>	lamb.mp3 Zagor had a littl
<dwihno>	This is what it might be like :)
<Zagor>	you run old code
<Zagor>	it is seamless now
<dwihno>	mkay
<Bagder>	upgrade! ;-)
<dwihno>	OLD?!
<dwihno>	It's 24 hours old man! :)
<dwihno>	Or perhaps 48
<Zagor>	yeah, i fixed that last night
<Bagder>	hehe
<Zagor>	that's stone-age code! :)
<dwihno>	:-)
<dwihno>	Did you take a peek at the LCD glitch?
<Zagor>	umm, remind me please?
<dwihno>	When scrolling across pages, the LCD did glitch
<dwihno>	Like old un-doublebuffered stuff :)
<dwihno>	Where is your lamb btw?
<Zagor>	ah, well we don't know why that happens. and yes, it is single buffered. we don't have two.
<Zagor>	lamb?
<dwihno>	yeah
<dwihno>	http://www.jupither.net/dw/ <-- like that, on that page ;)
<Bagder>	Zagor: you tried the id3 info Magnus mention on the list?
<Bagder>	id3 info bug
<Zagor>	i haven't read my mail yet, doing it now
<Bagder>	oh
<dwihno>	R-r-r-roockboooox!
<dwihno>	We need an anthem!
<Bagder>	yeah, the boot song! ;-)

<dwihno>	:)
<Bagder>	wooo, project activity stats on freshmeat
<Zagor>	really
<Bagder>	I meant graphs
<Zagor>	"Rating: 8.54/10.00 (1 vote)"
<Zagor>	how can one vote give average 8.54?
<Bagder>	hehe
<dwihno>	Magic math (tm)
<Bagder>	hey, I'm that single voter
<Bagder>	on rockbox
<Zagor>	this virus epidemic is getting seriously annoying
<Bagder>	Total (weighted)  8.54/10.00
<Bagder>	"weighted" is the keyword I gues
<Bagder>	guess
<Bagder>	Zagor: yes, but cut down the allowed size and it won't be as troublesome
<Zagor>	good point. 50k max now

<dwihno>	hehe
<dwihno>	not really

<Bagder>	neat
<dw|gone>	NEATO ZAGOR! All your box are belong to rock!
<dw|gone>	I'm off. Have a nice evening and try to stay indoors - the sun will cause cancer!
<Bagder>	I'd suggest you call it "shuffle" and not random
<Zagor>	good idea
<Zagor>	where do I find the currently loaded list?
<Bagder>	it's a global struct in playlist.c
<Zagor>	ok
*	Zagor wants current_tick in simulator... :)
<Zagor>	i'll just use time() instead
<Zagor>	for seed
<Bagder>	it doesn't really matter
<Bagder>	just increase the current
<Bagder>	or something
<Zagor>	i'll use the tick. otherwise it'll be the same every first time after boot
<Bagder>	right
<Zagor>	oops, core in playlist
<Zagor>	after 1002 lines
<Bagder>	ah
<Bagder>	there's a 1000 max
<Zagor>	oh
<Zagor>	i thought it was 10000 ?
<Bagder>	without any checks for it ;-)
<Bagder>	yeah, but I just used one
<Bagder>	raise it now
<Zagor>	will do
<Zagor>	adding check, too :)
<Bagder>	wooo
<Zagor>	what's index_array used for? I don't see it
<Bagder>	uh, remove ;-)
<Zagor>	ok
<jedix>	Zagor: why did you have to rewrite my scroll stuff?
<Zagor>	I chose a slightly different approach, that's all
<Zagor>	there was nothing wrong with your code
<Zagor>	to be able to do the new type of scroll, I sprintf the text into a string and then puts the string.
<Zagor>	for the new shuffle to be useful, we need a "next tracj" button
<Zagor>	track
<Bagder>	we could use that for playlist without shuffle too ;-)
<Zagor>	yep
<Zagor>	too bad we are out of buttons :)
<Bagder>	well
<Bagder>	we should have a special "screen" for showing while playing a track, right? I mean if we're not browsing the tree?
<Zagor>	yes we should. so you could go in and out between the browser and this screen
<Bagder>	right
<Zagor>	i.e. we need some UI work
<Zagor>	might want to save that for 1.2 though
<Bagder>	fair enough
<Bagder>	and if we play a track and idle in the tree browser, we could timeout back to the show-track-screen
<Bagder>	which I believe the archos firmware does
<Zagor>	we could, but I'm not sure I'd want it to. definitely a configurable option :)
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	the play-screen will be useful since it'll give more control of back/skip and volume up/down
<Bagder>	which isn't as easily available when tree browsing
<Zagor>	exactly
<--	jb1081 has quit ("[x]chat")
-->	jb1081 (~jb1081@lime.ircam.fr) has joined #rockbox
<Bagder>	the shuffle menu should probably say something if no playlist was loaded
<Zagor>	right
<Bagder>	I suspect people will do that
<Bagder>	I wonder how fast the playlist loader is on target
<Bagder>	I mean, compared to the original archos one
<Zagor>	i'd suspect somewhere in the order of 100 times faster :)
<Bagder>	it would be really cool
-->	edx (OKE60@pD9EAB848.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #rockbox
<edx>	hi
<Bagder>	hi!
<edx>	hmm... (maybe a stupid question... but..) would it be possible to write a keybard driver for the jukebox so we can plug in a usb keyboard :?
<Bagder>	no
<edx>	too sad.. why not?
<Bagder>	we can't use the USB for anything like that
<edx>	for what reason?
<Bagder>	it's out of reach
<edx>	damn.
<edx>	like a linux console on the recorder would rock ;)
*	Bagder puts a curl release together
<Zagor>	we can connect a keyboard to the remote control port
<edx>	hmm on the remote port... sounds good... :)
<edx>	Then I would have to build my own remote port.. but for a keyboard - no problem :)
<Zagor>	you need to build a serial converter for the keyboard, but the rest should be simple
<edx>	there are serial converter chips, right? (i dont have much knowledge about hardware unfortunately)
<Zagor>	yup. just like the gdb cable
<Zagor>	tested now. my 4500 line file takes about 5-6 seconds to load
<Bagder>	that's just totally awesome
<Zagor>	indeed
<Zagor>	but it'll be faster with some simple adjustments to playlist.c
<Bagder>	like what?
<Zagor>	it should be loading 512-byte blocks, not 255
-->	elinenbe (trilluser@bgp01080511bgs.wanarb01.mi.comcast.net) has joined #rockbox
<Bagder>	ah right
<Zagor>	fixing...
<elinenbe>	'ello
<edx>	lol ... now it takes like 5 secs for a 30 song playlist :P
<edx>	hi
<Bagder>	yeah, the stock firmware is shockingly slow at loading playlists
<elinenbe>	painfully slow.
<elinenbe>	so slow -- I usually take a dump, shower, and shave before it loads my 3 song playlist.
<Zagor>	also, we should accept both / and \ as separators. i suspect winamp creates files with \
<Bagder>	elinenbe: Zagor just tested, we load a 4500 song playlist in 5-6 seconds
<elinenbe>	that is great.
<elinenbe>	we are now talking full disk shuffle?
<Zagor>	yes we are
<Bagder>	yeah
<Bagder>	Zagor: we might get problems with paths too when we talk about files created by external programs
<Zagor>	yep. C:\my music\...
<Zagor>	:)
<Bagder>	yah
<elinenbe>	I am just wondering...  what is the status on playing sound on the AJBR
<Zagor>	Linus is working on that
<Bagder>	we should include Linus in our prayers ;-)
-->	ironi (ironi@as2-5-7.j.bonet.se) has joined #rockbox
<elinenbe>	I was wondering... does anyone else ever get the reversed screen on the recorder?
<Bagder>	hey ironi
<Bagder>	reversed screen?
<elinenbe>	even the rockbox bmp is reversed
<ironi>	Bagder: ?
<ironi>	hey Bagder
<edx>	huhu?
<Bagder>	gosh
<ironi>	Bagder: do u use emacs a lot?
<elinenbe>	where everything is flipped.
<Bagder>	ironi: nah, only 10-12 hours a day ;-P
<ironi>	Bagder: my irc script supports emacs commands
<elinenbe>	like you are looking at a mirror image of the screnn.
<ironi>	isnt that totally elite
<ironi>	=)
<Bagder>	elinenbe: and that happens every now or then or can you repeat it on demand?
<elinenbe>	no, happens every now and then.
<elinenbe>	not only is the screen mirrored, but it is offset about 16 pixels.
<Bagder>	it sounds if there's some lcd init we dont do
<elinenbe>	to the right.
<elinenbe>	no... that happens with the archos fimrware too.
<Bagder>	ah
<elinenbe>	on the recorder.
<Bagder>	then it might be a defect hardware perhaps
<edx>	hm then thats a hardware bug (?)
<elinenbe>	yeah I dont know if anyone else ever gets that.
<edx>	i have a recorder. never ever got that.
<Bagder>	I've never seen it either
<ironi>	i have a player, and I lvoe the double size text
<Bagder>	hehe
<ironi>	the browsing and the scrolling are so FAST
<ironi>	i just love this
<edx>	hehe
<ironi>	I want to contribute som uch
<elinenbe>	is the double size text an option on the player rockbox?
<Zagor>	you have already: the web site!
<ironi>	but there is still an error with how directories are displayed, though.
<ironi>	at least for me
<Bagder>	elinenbe: yeps
<Zagor>	elinenbe: the new models use it as logo
<elinenbe>	nice :)
<Zagor>	ironi: what error is that?
<ironi>	Zagor: well let me try to explain
<elinenbe>	the scrolling through a directory is quite slow on the recorder -- and there is quite a bit of flicker.
<ironi>	my dir that is called F-J
<Zagor>	elinenbe: yes, we're not sure why
<ironi>	is displayed as F-J1  q|| r
<Zagor>	ironi: which version is this?
<ironi>	but only whgen scrolling down
<ironi>	if i go down and go back up its F-J
<ironi>	Zagor: the latest?
<ironi>	i got it last night
<Bagder>	this morning?
<elinenbe>	I was wondering -- does this sound like something that is a good idea:  instead of scrolling only the title that the cursor is on, scroll everything on the current screen that is wider then the screen?
<ironi>	no last night
<ironi>	lemme get this mornings
<Bagder>	ironi: please do
<ironi>	an optional go to usb mode yes/no would be pleasant
<ironi>	when plugging it in
<Zagor>	elinenbe: well, i have to ask "why?" :)
<ironi>	that would be terribly confusing on fast scroll
<elinenbe>	well, lets say you have 10 songs named "Red Hot Chili Peppers - Songname 1
<Zagor>	hmm, maybe we should do the vertical recorder scroll using bitmap instead redrawing the chars
<elinenbe>	"Red Hot Chili Peppers - Songname 2
<elinenbe>	etc...
<ironi>	hm
<Bagder>	Zagor: that's a good idea
<Zagor>	elinenbe: ah, you mean scroll all lines and not just one?
<elinenbe>	and you want to play a certain one.
<ironi>	im thinking of something
<elinenbe>	yes.
<ironi>	that moving through a dir in the player should give movement on every push
<Zagor>	we could try
<elinenbe>	if it were a bitmap scroll, then couldn't you easily do pixel by pixel?
<Zagor>	elinenbe: yes we could
<ironi>	i.e. not just moving the arrow down if its on top when scrolling down the first one
<ironi>	it confuses me totally
<Zagor>	ironi: hehe. well yes there is lots of UI work left :)
<Zagor>	i have to go now, they're closing the office!
<ironi>	Zagor: can i be the UI general, please please please
<Zagor>	see you tomorrow, everyone
<ironi>	=)
<ironi>	ok so lets see the newset build
<ironi>	same error
*	Bagder hands ironi the UI boss hat
<ironi>	hehe
<ironi>	i wan tso much to be in the credz =)
<ironi>	*waNNABE*
<ironi>	anyway
<Zagor>	we'll add you for the web site
<ironi>	hehe cool =)
<ironi>	anyway
<ironi>	the browsing should have a slight delay
<Zagor>	gotta run, bye
<--	Zagor has quit ("Client Exiting")
<elinenbe>	what do you mean by the browsing should have a slight delay?
<elinenbe>	later.
<ironi>	cause now when i push i scroll by 3 rows like nothing
<ironi>	with a 2-row display this is very annoying
<Bagder>	right
<Bagder>	the buttons are a bit sensitive
<ironi>	yeahm, thats the least you could say
<ironi>	the scrolling should be settable from 1-10
<ironi>	everything over 15 is totally underadable, isnt it
<Bagder>	...not on the recorder ;-)
<edx>	hehe ;)
<ironi>	the menu button should have like a 0.3 second delay when pushed
<ironi>	i.e. you need to hold it for that time
*	edx looks down to his recorder and smiles..
<ironi>	to activate
<elinenbe>	I like the recorder at 25
<ironi>	oh really? ok. well 5 is neat fo rme
<ironi>	6 manybe
<elinenbe>	is there any saving of values to the disk yet?
<Bagder>	no
<ironi>	oh really
<ironi>	well how will this be saved?
<elinenbe>	how si that going to be handled?
<ironi>	just a textfile
<ironi>	config file
<ironi>	is it possible to implement that
<Bagder>	sure
<ironi>	cause hten we could move on and make a filehandler
<elinenbe>	in an unused sector -- like the default firmware does it?
<ironi>	that can make dirs, copy, delete
<ironi>	=)))
<ironi>	hehe maybe a bit of an overkill
<elinenbe>	I like the idea of an ascii config file.
<ironi>	i would love to be able to read txt-files
<ironi>	lovely to make notes for grocery shopping hah
<Bagder>	contribution time!
<ironi>	it sahould be possible to make a game for the player too
<ironi>	am i wqrong or is the disk read alot shorter with rockbox firmware?
<ironi>	when entering new dirs
<Bagder>	dunno
<Bagder>	gotta run, see ya tomorrow
<ironi>	have you ever played arkanoid?
<elinenbe>	later.
<elinenbe>	go home.
<--	Bagder (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has left #rockbox
<ironi>	that would be able to do on the player
<ironi>	=)
<ironi>	a vertical arcanoid
<elinenbe>	that would be nice.
<ironi>	elinenbe: do you know how to set it up to be able to compile everyitng in windows?
<elinenbe>	no.  I was messing around with it.
<elinenbe>	but I guess over the last few days, a bunch has been done to it.
<ironi>	ok
<elinenbe>	you need to use nmake.
<ironi>	i think i will do linux trough vmware maybe
<ironi>	kinda easier
<elinenbe>	follow the directions on the web page -- they are easy to follow.
<ironi>	im more used to compile in linux so ill jsut stick to that
<ironi>	and play around with vmware at the same time hehe

<edx>	rehi ;)
<Zagor>	hi
<edx>	Zagor: does the playback work on the recorder?
<Zagor>	not yet
<edx>	k
<edx>	(didnt work for me.. that's why i'm asking)
<edx>	i modified the makefile so it compiles on windows (but it wont compile on linux with that makefile anymore..)
<edx>	we gotta make a makefile for windows & linux
<edx>	(not now.. sometime later.. ;) )
<Zagor>	what did you change?
<edx>	i removed the dependency stuff
<Zagor>	oh...
<edx>	(scripting does not work in windows..)
<edx>	no sh.exe
<Zagor>	i know
<edx>	at least i get a compiled file that actually works...
<edx>	we could also create a makefile.win32 or something (for win32 users who want to compile the firmware..)
<Zagor>	yes
<edx>	maybe that will be easier than having a linwin file...
<edx>	also, i think the if statements dont work under windows.
<edx>	(i had to remove them to get the recorder code compiled..)
<Zagor>	are you using nmake?
<edx>	no
<edx>	i use the make that comes with the GNUSH tool chain
<edx>	nmake really is a whole different story
<Zagor>	what does "make --version" report?
<edx>	GNU Make version 3.78.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
<edx>	Built for Windows32
<Zagor>	what does it say when you have the if lines?
<edx>	nothing, it just does not do what inside the if lines...
<edx>	(though it should)
<edx>	what = what is
<Zagor>	ok
<edx>	how far is rolo btw (is it even developed at the moment?)
<Zagor>	no, we haven't started with it yet.
<edx>	ok... because if we had that I could at least put rockbox on there to play (and still listen to music heheh)
<edx>	right now rolo will play a pretty important role, specially for those people who are unsure whether to use rockbox or the archos mod
<Zagor>	i know, i want rolo too. it's just we don't have unlimited manpower :)
<edx>	true.
<edx>	If I could i'd help but I guess I have to little low-level experience...
<edx>	the file must be read to ram and then.. the instruction pointer set to that location (correct me if i am totally wrong)
<Zagor>	your helping very much already, with the win32 stuff
<Zagor>	yes, but there are "a few" other things too :)
<edx>	(yea.. must be the correct place in ram etc..)
<edx>	and the rolo must be deleted out of ram i guess (because the archos mod wants to use all of the ram and is designed for that i guess)
<edx>	anyways.. nice revery hehe
<Zagor>	yes, rolo will be overwritten by the mod
<edx>	ok
<edx>	i gotta get some sleep... last class test for this school year tomorrow :D

<g003y>	I always have to go back to that dang nick reference :D
<Zagor>	hehe
<g003y>	you guys on the other side of the pond are still up?
<Zagor>	I'd like to use "Bjorn", but unfortunately it's registered to someone else
<Zagor>	yeah, it's 22:55 here
<g003y>	yeah I just randomly typed g003y into trillian :D
<Zagor>	hehe
<g003y>	Zagor - Bagder told me to get an SF account setup and talk to you about getting ssh cvs access.
<g003y>	you the man for that ?
<Zagor>	yep
<g003y>	cool
<g003y>	I've been working on some stuff locally
<Zagor>	yeah?
<g003y>	playing around with displaying filenames and such as songs play
<g003y>	getting my head around the api
<g003y>	more apps stuff
<Zagor>	ok, nice
<g003y>	I'm not a hardware guy like all yousese :D.  But I know C and applications :D
<g003y>	anyway I was looking at adding a real primitive display format
<g003y>	right now I can compile with support for scrolling the filename or using the current behavior
<g003y>	it actually works nicely thanks to those wonderful scrolling apis :D
<Zagor>	:)
<g003y>	so I was thinking of having just a couple of different things we can support
<g003y>	with playing file display
<Zagor>	sure
<g003y>	id3 info being one
<g003y>	scrolling filename being another
<g003y>	but potentially a way to instruct the play how to disect your filename/directory structure to build id3 like information on the screen
<g003y>	play == player
<Zagor>	yes, that'd be good
<g003y>	but the real question right now is....
<g003y>	should I make it a compiled in option or something that could be configured through settings?
<Zagor>	settings, definitely
<g003y>	ok cool.  
<g003y>	that is how I would prefer it
<g003y>	anyway I will get an sf account email ya
<Zagor>	ok
<g003y>	BTW - your cross compiler buld instructions worked first shot for me.
<Zagor>	nice!
<g003y>	took me about 5 minutes to get up and running
<g003y>	I'm on win32 using cygwin as well
<g003y>	one other question for you.  Whats the deal with the battery display?  I've only started logging recently and haven't dug through all the old logs yet
<Zagor>	we have no battery display yet
<g003y>	I noticed :D
<g003y>	but is it an unknown thing 
<Zagor>	measuring battery capacity is a whole science in itself
<g003y>	ahhh
<Zagor>	so we're putting that off a bit until the basic stuff works
<g003y>	cool
<elinenbe>	g003y: how do you use the make files in win32?
<g003y>	I do everything through the bash shell cygwin provides
<g003y>	so technically I use the *nix like make
<g003y>	but if you're attempting the uisimulator compile then you need to use nmake
<g003y>	from a dos window
<elinenbe>	oh -- how does that work?  I am not familiar with the bash shell that comew with cygwin
<elinenbe>	did you download the source tarball or use wincvs
<g003y>	are you just trying to get the firmware configured?
<g003y>	I sync to current with wincvs
<g003y>	but I started with the tarballs
<elinenbe>	well, I want to be able to compile the firmware.
<g003y>	ok
<g003y>	cygwin gives you a little batch file you double click
<g003y>	that gives you a shell right?  That is bash 
<g003y>	from there you would build the cross compiler as Bjorn has put together on the website
<elinenbe>	I know bash and linux
<g003y>	I tried the GNU-SH toolkit, but it just wasn't cutting it for me
<g003y>	ok good well cygwin gives you the same stuff basically
<elinenbe>	I was just unfamiliar with the bash shell that is makes for windows.
<g003y>	it's close, but not exactly the same
<g003y>	just use the batch file they plop on the desktop and it will put you in your home directory
<g003y>	from there it will feel more familiar
<elinenbe>	ok
<g003y>	setup all your normal include stuff and everything
<elinenbe>	did you just follow the directions on the web page?
<g003y>	then just do the configure & compile
<elinenbe>	http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/sh-win/
<g003y>	yeah except
<g003y>	no not that one
<g003y>	I couldn't get compiles to work with that tool kit
<elinenbe>	not what?
<elinenbe>	oh, so what toolkit did you use?
<g003y>	http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/cross-gcc.html
<g003y>	I followed those directions
<g003y>	inside of a cygwin win32 bash shell
<g003y>	GNU-SH just wouldn't fly for me
<elinenbe>	well, where did you dl the cygwin bash shell.
<elinenbe>	?
<g003y>	http://www.cgywin.org/
<g003y>	just go for the installer
<elinenbe>	ok.  thanks so much.
<g003y>	get the packages you need to get yourself started
<g003y>	though you won't need newlib compiled in
<g003y>	so you can drop that bit 
<g003y>	after cygwin does it's thing you will need to recompile gcc with the sh1 extensions
<elinenbe>	the page you speak of is http://www.cygwin.com/
<elinenbe>	ok
<g003y>	oh yeah d....o....t....com
<g003y>	:D
<g003y>	anyway you will need gcc to get to gcc 3.x with sh1
<elinenbe>	so, you just downloaded the gcc and installed as per insturction on http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/cross-gcc.html?
<g003y>	yup
<g003y>	minus newlib
<PsycoXul>	hmm
<PsycoXul>	why not newlib?
<Zagor>	we aren't using it any more
<PsycoXul>	ah
<PsycoXul>	cool
<g003y>	IDK - I saw on the mailing list not to use it
<Zagor>	just a few header files are still needed
<g003y>	there ya go :D
<elinenbe>	ok -- great.  Thanks so much.
<g003y>	no prob
-->	Bagder (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has joined #rockbox
<Zagor>	hey bro
<Bagder>	hey
<g003y>	heh... so you guys are related?
<Zagor>	yeah, we're brothers
<Zagor>	the playlist loader reads around 1000 lines per second. that's not bad!
<g003y>	thats pretty damn good
<Bagder>	it's so darned cool
<Zagor>	sure is
<Bagder>	so the shuffle stuff works now?
<Zagor>	umm, haven't tried it yet. the batteries in my player are empty (and the charger circuit is busted)
<Zagor>	i have only tested on the recorder so far
<Zagor>	it should go even faster on the player, since it's clocked faster
<Zagor>	not very much, though
<Bagder>	about 9%
<g003y>	I'll give it a try tonight when I recompile
<g003y>	I have a player
<Bagder>	neato
<Zagor>	ok
<Bagder>	we need the playlist tested a bit
<g003y>	I'm just at my day job right now coding less interesting crap
<Bagder>	g003y: so what kind of stuff do you work with?
<g003y>	a mixture of win32 & *nixes
<g003y>	C, perl asp... whatever needs to be done mostly
<g003y>	most of our FEs are IIS
<Zagor>	ueck :)
<g003y>	but lots of the behind the scenes is unixy
<g003y>	hey I even hop on the g4 once and awhile to pretend I have a flipper for the mouse button :D
<Zagor>	hehe
<Bagder>	:-)

*	Bagder smiles
<Zagor>	hehe
<g003y>	I don't see rockbox there yet :D
<g003y>	j (score: 44,252 - 36.97%)
<g003y>	A programmer's editor written in Java.
<g003y>	that is up there, but VI or VIM is not?
<Zagor>	it's a new rating system, there hasn't been a lot of votes yet
<g003y>	ahhhhh... gotcha
<Bagder>	vitality isn't based on that
<Zagor>	ah, yes that was vitality
<Bagder>	but it requires rather frequent releases
<Zagor>	vi has vitality 0.01% :)
<g003y>	gotcha
<Zagor>	vim is at 0.51%
<Bagder>	so more stable projects tend to get less "vital"
<Zagor>	rockbox is at 0.00
<g003y>	well how is popularity rated?
<Bagder>	I honestly don't know how any of those numbers are calculated
<Zagor>	"The popularity score superseded the old counters for record hits, URL hits and subscriptions. Popularity is calculated as (record hits * URL hits * (subscriptions + 1))^(1/3)."
<Bagder>	oh
<Bagder>	curl =  Popularity: 12.84% (Rank 100)
<Zagor>	"The vitality score for a project is calculated  like this: (announcements * age) / (last_announcement)"
<g003y>	oh there is the link I was looking for that zagor kindly regurigiated for me :D
<Zagor>	hehe
*	Zagor is trying to get used to mutt...
<g003y>	mutt is nice
<g003y>	unfortunately I haven't converted yet
<Zagor>	i've used elm and thenpine for the last 10 years, so it's hard for me to change
<Bagder>	I've built my whole life around pine ;-)
<g003y>	hahahahahaha
<Bagder>	Zagor: so what's left for a 1.1 release?
<Zagor>	nothing, really. I just want to test it a bit more.
<Bagder>	ok
<Bagder>	just checking ;-)
<Zagor>	i'm thinking maybe "Shuffle" should be an "on/off" option rather than an action
<Bagder>	yes
<Bagder>	and possible a "reshuffle" as an action
<Zagor>	so you set it before you start the playlist
<Bagder>	possibly
<Zagor>	yeah
<Bagder>	did you time the shuffle of 4500 songs?
<Bagder>	or didn't you try it?
<Zagor>	i did. 5120 songs takes just under 5 seconds
<Bagder>	yes, to read from a file, right?
<Zagor>	oh, the shuffle. hang on...
<Bagder>	I meant only the shuffle part
<Zagor>	it's very quick. sub-second i think
<Bagder>	that is great
<Zagor>	tested now. it's like 0.5 seconds.
<g003y>	schweet
<Bagder>	it makes me feel really warm inside that our thoughs prove to be working so good
<Zagor>	yes, i agree
<Zagor>	and this means 1.1 will be a real alternative for some people. still very unpolished, but with one killer feature
<Bagder>	yeah
<g003y>	shuffle that blows archos' effort out of the water?
<Zagor>	fast and big playlists
<g003y>	I thought you were talking just shuffle there
<Zagor>	archos don't do shuffling like this, so there's no real comparison.
<g003y>	another killer feature?
<Zagor>	but they do load playlists, at a horrible speed
<g003y>	the playlist stuff is horrible on theirs
<Zagor>	the huge playlist support is our killer feature
<g003y>	they've got features, but sacrificed speed
<g003y>	yeah thats great
<PsycoXul>	whats its limit? memory? heh
<PsycoXul>	or hd space?
<PsycoXul>	or what
<Zagor>	we set a 10000 entry limit
<Bagder>	they probably just do it "The Wrong Way"
<Zagor>	memory is the limit, since we need to hold one integer per entry
<PsycoXul>	heh
<g003y>	I thought the integer solution was quite crafty.
<g003y>	I believe archos is doing something far nastier with memory usage
<Zagor>	I like it
<Zagor>	oooh yes...
<Bagder>	just watching the time it takes to load a playlist indicates something really nasty
<g003y>	so have any of the archos ppl contacted the group about this project in any way?
<Zagor>	nope
<Zagor>	they ignore us vehemently :)
<g003y>	you're making their dev team look bad :D
<Zagor>	hehe
<Bagder>	we've gone from completely *nothing* to this point in ~6 months
<g003y>	fricking good stuff :)
<Zagor>	all the code is written since april...
<Bagder>	hehe
<Bagder>	can you run a simulated player?
<Zagor>	yes
<Bagder>	it just died so hard on me
<Zagor>	but I get a lot of those X errors
<Bagder>	I can't even close gdb now!
<Bagder>	The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y
<Zagor>	that happened to me too the other day
<Bagder>	Error accessing memory address 0x4018d664: No such process.
<g003y>	doh!
<Zagor>	ouch
<Bagder>	had to kill it manually from another terminal
<Bagder>	hm
<g003y>	ok
<g003y>	sorry wrong window :D
<g003y>	dang trillian makes that stuff confusing :D
<Bagder>	it just does not work here
<Zagor>	odd
<Bagder>	all I see is the initial screen
<Bagder>	and nothing more happens

<Zagor>	any empty dir will crash it
<Bagder>	yeah
<Zagor>	fixed

<Bagder>	better
<Bagder>	but what is the question mark doing there?
<Zagor>	it's the cursor
<Bagder>	ah
<Zagor>	special char on player
<Bagder>	we should fake that better in the simulator
<Zagor>	yup
<Zagor>	i also want icons in the player simulator soon...
<Bagder>	true
<Bagder>	shouldn't be too hard
<Bagder>	I like the scroll
<Zagor>	yeah, it's nice. your idea was better.
<Bagder>	I think so too, it fills better
<Zagor>	the code is actually simpler for this scroll than the previous model

<Bagder>	booo ;-)
<g003y>	get those perl scripts out :D
<PsycoXul>	i'm not one for listening to the same set over again
<PsycoXul>	:p
<Bagder>	hehe
<Zagor>	make a list of the whole disk
<PsycoXul>	how do you start the playlist?
<Bagder>	play
<g003y>	ha!
<PsycoXul>	hmm
<g003y>	no go?
<PsycoXul>	it just says loading nnn files, complete
<PsycoXul>	and thats it
<Zagor>	doesn't start playing?
<PsycoXul>	no
<g003y>	format of playlist affect it?
<Zagor>	the display isn't supposed to say title or anything. but it's supposed to play the files.
<Zagor>	odd. works in the sim
<PsycoXul>	they're playlists that archos' firmware saved
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Bagder>	they should be fine
<Zagor>	ah, how did you make those playlists?
<g003y>	_should_ is the keyword in that sentence
<Bagder>	hehe, of course
<Zagor>	i bet there are backslashes and/or disk names in there?
<Bagder>	I don't think so
<Bagder>	mine didn't
<g003y>	zagor - what format does the code expect?
<PsycoXul>	lemme look at what they look like
<Bagder>	normal / slash
<Zagor>	forward slashes, no C: 
<g003y>	CR-LF combo?
<g003y>	or just LF?
<Bagder>	either way
<Bagder>	ah
<Bagder>	its broke
<g003y>	I was just about to try it, but not now :D
<PsycoXul>	./Nine Inch Nails/The Fragile/Left/01 - somewhat damaged.mp3
<Zagor>	kill the leading dot
<Bagder>	initial dot huh? :-)
<Bagder>	Zagor: the code doesn't work with CRLF right now
<Zagor>	ok
<PsycoXul>	heh that shouldn't be a problem :p 
<PsycoXul>	and they're dos format text too
*	PsycoXul makes a whole-disk playlist
<PsycoXul>	oh damnit whats find's problem
*	PsycoXul runs it through sort
<PsycoXul>	thats better
<PsycoXul>	i noticed directories that start with a . don't show up in the browser
<Zagor>	you can't have that in fat32, can you?
<PsycoXul>	yeah i've got a few of them
<PsycoXul>	just cause they also don't show up in archos' browser and they have either oggs or mp3's that are silent for no apparent reason on the archos [or maybe just with archos' firmware, i haven't tried them with rockbox]
<Zagor>	ok
<Zagor>	i need to test that. we don't do any filtering so that's a bug
<Bagder>	Zagor: is the fs code totally case insensitive?
<Zagor>	it should be, but there may be bugs
<Bagder>	ok
<Bagder>	it just struck me
<Zagor>	umm, no. it's totally sensitive
<Zagor>	bad move :)
<Bagder>	dang
<Zagor>	buh, now we need to add strnicmp to common/
<Bagder>	heh
<Bagder>	strncasecmp() ?
<Zagor>	yes
<Bagder>	(I'm just nitpicking on the name)
<Zagor>	i know :)
<PsycoXul>	ok my complete playlist ends up 2641 tracks
<Zagor>	try loading it. you'll like it :)
<Bagder>	ok, I'm off. See ya mañana
<--	Bagder (~daniel@as3-3-2.ras.s.bonet.se) has left #rockbox
<PsycoXul>	hmm
<PsycoXul>	still doesn't play
<PsycoXul>	/Ac-Dc/Back In Black/01-Hells Bells.mp3
<PsycoXul>	format, unix-style text
<Zagor>	ok
<PsycoXul>	hmm after i started playing a file and pressing stop to go back to the browser, the ui sorta paused with a jerky scroll of the file it was on, for a second or two before letting me do anything
<g003y>	different question (sorry to hijack) - Is there a way to go back to the playing display after exiting back to the browser?
<PsycoXul>	and bass over 70% has nasty clipping on this AC/DC song heh, even at lower volumes
<PsycoXul>	g003y: thats a good question
<PsycoXul>	and there's still random files that get displayed with junk names
<PsycoXul>	directories anyways i dunno about files actualy
<Zagor>	g003y: currently there is no way to do that
<Zagor>	PsycoXul: that might be short FAT names. I haven't been able to test those much.
<g003y>	zagor - hmm... how about like a fetaure that returns to it when a user has idled on pressing buttons or would that be overdoing it?
<Zagor>	i don't like the machine to decide things on its own. i think a simple toggle button is better
<g003y>	I believe button combos are precious on the player.
<g003y>	ok
<g003y>	sounds fair to me
<PsycoXul>	i think this one is called 'disc 2 misc' or something i dunno about the white spaces or if tehy're -'s or _'s, i forget, but it displays as 'isk_2_-_02_-_'
<Zagor>	check to be sure
<PsycoXul>	oh i've probably got it on the playlist i've just made so i can look at that heh
<PsycoXul>	ah its actualy 'disc3-misc'
<PsycoXul>	heh
<Zagor>	and how is it displayed?
<PsycoXul>	'isk_2_-_02_0_'
<PsycoXul>	er
<PsycoXul>	'isk_2_-_02_-_'
<Zagor>	veeery odd
<PsycoXul>	yeah and 'Beck' is displayed as 'Ozzy.m3u.m3u'
<g003y>	left over buffer garbage?
<Zagor>	looks like it, yeah
<PsycoXul>	and 'Adam Sandler' is 'HMC1 Y?? U?' the ?'s actualy being little 3's as if they're being cubed heh
<Zagor>	it's the fat32 driver
<g003y>	psyco- is that only happening on playlists for you?
<PsycoXul>	no its the display of these directories in the browser
<g003y>	oh sorry
<PsycoXul>	and these funky names are consistant
<g003y>	I thought it was the filenames
<PsycoXul>	they're always these heh
<g003y>	heh... well at least it's consistent
<PsycoXul>	though the adam sandler one the little 3's used to be other chars in older rockbox versions heh
<g003y>	I think zagor is jamming over some fat32 code right now as we speak :D
<Zagor>	what, me? :)
<PsycoXul>	oh 'Misc-junk' also displays as 'Pilots.m3u'
<PsycoXul>	and you know whatever else heh
<PsycoXul>	hmm
<PsycoXul>	and i go into the recycled dir
<PsycoXul>	where theres some wav files
<PsycoXul>	and i select one
<PsycoXul>	and then stop it
<Zagor>	this is not short-name issues. misc-junk is 9 chars == longname
<PsycoXul>	and then press stop again to leave the recycled dir
<PsycoXul>	and i get DH0 DH1 and INFO2 
<PsycoXul>	displayed in the browser
<Zagor>	eh?
<g003y>	I'm trying to reproduce it right now, but not much luck here
<PsycoXul>	ok its also sometimes just going into the recycled dir
<PsycoXul>	and sometimes leaving it
<PsycoXul>	hmm unless they're actualy in there and the bounce is putting me into the first one
<Zagor>	well I need to gdb this, so it'll have to wait until the morning
<PsycoXul>	ok i think thats whats going on with the DH0 DH1 and INFO2 things is just that i didn't see them there at first because of the button sensitivity so disregard that one
<Zagor>	ok, good

<adi|work>	jesus..
<adi|work>	just tested the playlist with 2000 line file
<adi|work>	that sucker flys :)
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<PsycoXul>	Loadding...
<adi|work>	and i love the variable scroll
<PsycoXul>	Complete.
<PsycoXul>	2641 files
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<adi|work>	hehe i don't even see the Loading in the sim ;)
<PsycoXul>	i just wish this playlist would actualy
<PsycoXul>	you know...
<PsycoXul>	play
<PsycoXul>	:p
<adi|work>	heheh hmmm odd
<PsycoXul>	yeah it just loads
<adi|work>	shuffle core dumps the sim
<PsycoXul>	here it says "Shuffling..
<PsycoXul>	Done."
<adi|work>	yeah.. but i let it go and it cores...
<PsycoXul>	damn
<PsycoXul>	even at 70% bass i get some clipping
<adi|work>	on the player?
<PsycoXul>	yeah
<PsycoXul>	what happened man... heh
<adi|work>	ahh.. i only have recorder :(
<PsycoXul>	last day of last month i tried it
<PsycoXul>	and the browser was a little slow but there was no oversensitivity
<PsycoXul>	and you could crank the bass all the way without any clipping and it sounded good
<PsycoXul>	now its all oversensitive and clipping in the bass heh

<PsycoXul>	this one soundtrack too, the first track locks rockbox up
<PsycoXul>	tried it like 3 or 4 times
<adi|work>	hehehe
<PsycoXul>	just freezes with the browser display still on it
<PsycoXul>	yeah it is odd, the rest of the tracks in it seem to work fine
<adi|work>	we're violating memory somewhere in the sim...
<adi|work>	tracking it down
<PsycoXul>	so like i think from interface end that it'd be nice if it wants to stay in the playing-file-info-display while its playing
<PsycoXul>	and stop from there will stop it and return to browser while some other button or combo can switch between that and the browser while its still playing
<PsycoXul>	at least on the player, i know the recorder's got different buttons so it can behave different ways appropriate to it, but this makes sense to me on the player
<adi|work>	damn it.. i dont know what it is...
<adi|work>	but the sim is definatly bugging out

<g003y>	ahh back again :D
<g003y>	psyco - did you get that garbage display resolved?
<adi|work>	umm... day before last i think
<g003y>	he was having a problem earlier though
<g003y>	today that is
<PsycoXul>	well i think zagor was looking into it
<PsycoXul>	or not
<PsycoXul>	but there was a split and when it returned he didn't come back with it
<PsycoXul>	heh
<PsycoXul>	so i dunno whats going on
<g003y>	oh ok
<g003y>	I wasn't able to reproduce it, but I don't think I followed your steps exactly
<PsycoXul>	er? steps?
<PsycoXul>	the problem is with some directories
<g003y>	only some.... hmmmm
<PsycoXul>	right
<PsycoXul>	a few of them display weird things instead of what they are
<PsycoXul>	and the weird things they display are always the same, between reboots, different compiles, different versions, etc
<PsycoXul>	except one of them has changed a little between versions
<g003y>	hmmmm.... very strange.  I was trying to see it happen on my player, but no go
<g003y>	ah well Zagor will figure it out :D

<dwihno>	oops :)
<g003y>	heh... thats what I get for having two alias files :D.  damn backups.
<dwihno>	yeah, backups are a pain in the ass ;)
<g003y>	hehehe
<g003y>	guess I will just wait and see what happens.
<dwihno>	yeah
<dwihno>	Have you done any productive stuff for rockbox? :)
<g003y>	not today
<g003y>	I'm trying to get my account setup so I can submit what I have at least 
<g003y>	talked with Zagor and he liked my ideas
<g003y>	so I guess I will jam some code soon
<g003y>	that and try to finish gta3 one day :D
<dwihno>	ah
<dwihno>	gta3? is it possible to finish that game? :)
<g003y>	man... I tell ya.  it always ends up in a game of how long can I live with x number of stars :D
<g003y>	I'm still only on the second island
<dwihno>	Island?
<dwihno>	Hmm

<g003y>	ahhhh... you waiting on the ones with the nice nvidia/ati 3d cards in them?
<g003y>	or something even more portable than a laptop?
<dwihno>	Nah, it's a laptop alright
<dwihno>	With a geforce4 go chip
<dwihno>	I can't live without q3a! :)
<g003y>	oh yeah thats sweet
<dwihno>	But I've been waiting for this invoice for almost a month now and I'm running out of patience
<elinenbe>	dwihno: I just got the toshiba 5105-s607 and it is incredible
<g003y>	geez.... surely it isn't hard to pay up.
<dwihno>	elinenbe: That purple thing?
<elinenbe>	well, more blue, but it is incredible
<dwihno>	Yeah
<elinenbe>	except for the battery life.
<dwihno>	I bet it is :)
<elinenbe>	that is the only thing I could complain about.
<dwihno>	It's a monster! :)
<elinenbe>	It is great.
<dwihno>	It's perversion at its greatest ;)
<elinenbe>	much faster/better/etc. then my old HUGE tower.

<elinenbe>	512 ram
<elinenbe>	40 gig hard drive
<dwihno>	sweet stuff :)~
<elinenbe>	15 inch 1600x1200 resolution monitor (easily the sharpest brightest monitor I have EVER used)
<g003y>	oh yeah.... you guys are making me horny with those specs :D
<elinenbe>	and I have had a 21 inch flat screen sony for a while.
<dwihno>	:)
<elinenbe>	flat CRT that is...
<elinenbe>	GREAT speakers including a SUBWOOFER!! (no joke!)
<elinenbe>	it is just incredible.
<elinenbe>	I went through 3 laptops getting this one.
<dwihno>	The dell-box I'm gonna get is a 1.6 P4-M, 512 RAM, 30 (or 40) gig drive.... And 1400xsomething screen
<elinenbe>	first a HP, then a Gateway, then this.
<elinenbe>	and this is BY far the best.
<elinenbe>	8x dvd/cdr/cdrw
<elinenbe>	usually 1450x1200
<elinenbe>	or something like that

<g003y>	fucking eh
<dwihno>	15.1" something

<g003y>	that just owns
<dwihno>	yeah
<dwihno>	But as everything else, there is a pricetag :(
<dwihno>	I would get that toshiba if I was rich & famous
<g003y>	yeah I know... thats the hard part
<g003y>	hahahahahaha
<dwihno>	But I'm neither rich or famous, so I guess the Dell will be perfect for me ;)

<elinenbe>	15.1 screen
