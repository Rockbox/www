ct-ng-config is the .config file for crosstools-NG[1]. This builds
a working toolchain for the Samsung YP-R0 app target, so Rockbox
can be compiled as an app.

alsalib.tar.gc has headers and runtime libraries for libasound found on
the Samsung YP-R0. The headers are extracted from a debian .deb package
(package: libasound2-dev (1.0.13-2), Debian etch [2]). The runtime libraries
are extracted from the device (actually, from a OF update package [3]).
Unfortunately, Samsung did not provide the sources for alsalib they use,
hence we can't do this here. No file is modified, though, we are only
redestributing.

The runtime libraries and headers are only used for compilation. We don't
ship them in rockbox.zip.
