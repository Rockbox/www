#define _PAGE_ User Manual
#include "head.t"

<h2>General concept</h2>
<p>
The Rockbox user interface consists of three main screens:
<ul>
<li>The Directory Browser
<li>The While Playing Screen (WPS)
<li>The Menu
</ul>

<p>The <a href="dir.html">Directory Browser</a> is where you find yourself
immediately after boot. It is used for exploring your harddisk and selecting files for playing or other functions. <a href="dir.html">Click here</a> for more information.

<p>The <a href="wps.html">While Playing Screen</a> is the screen displayed while you are playing mp3 files. It contains information about the track you are playing. <a href="wps.html">Click here</a> for more information.

<p>The <a href="menu.html">Menu</a> is where you can access all settings and auxiliary functions of the Rockbox software. <a href="menu.html">Click here</a> for more information.

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Apart from all the <a href="menu.html">settings</a>, the major points 
of configuration are:

<ul>
<li><a href="/fonts/">Loadable fonts</a>
<li><a href="/lang/">Loadable languages</a>
<li><a href="/docs/custom_wps_format.html">Loadable WPS template</a>
<li><a href="/docs/custom_cfg_format.html">Loadable CFG format</a>
</ul>

<h2>Button notation</h2>
<p>
Since the Players and the Recorders provide mostly the same functions, this manual describes them both in the same pages. However, the key bindings differ for various features. This will be noted by a a (p) or (r) suffix to the key, like this:

<p><table class=buttontable>
<tr><th>Button</th><th>Function</th>
<tr valign=top>
<td> UP (r) <br> LEFT (p) </td>
<td> Go to previous item in list.
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In the above example: Recorders use the UP button while players use the LEFT button.
