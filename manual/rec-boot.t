<p> When Rockbox boots up it'll display the Rockbox logo (with the version
number beneath) for a short time.

<p>
 If you have previously set 'Resume' to ASK or ON, you will now either get a
question about doing the resume or the resume will be done automaticly.

<p>
 If you selected no on the resume question, or had 'Resume' set to OFF, it'll
jump right into the <a href="rec-dir.html">dir browser</a> showing the root
(toplevel) directory of your Archos.
