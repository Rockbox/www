Rockbox FAQ


Q. What is Rockbox, what is it's purpose?
A. The purpose of this project is to write an Open Source replacement 
   firmware for the Archos Jukebox 6000, Studio 20 and Recorder MP3 players.

Q. Can the changes or the software that Rockbox suggests or offers 
   possibly damage my Archos Player?
A. All firmware mods that are presented still highly experimental. 
   Try them on your own risk. We offer no garuntee that this software/hardware
   changes won't damage your player or void your warentee.

Q. Do you have a mailing list?
A. Sure do! The list is rockbox@cool.haxx.se.  To subscribe, send you need to
   send a message to majordomo@cool.haxx.se with the words "subscribe rockbox"
   in the body. 

Q. Great you have a mailing list!  Is there anyway for me to catch up on
   past posts?
A. Check out the archives at: http://bjorn.haxx.se/rockbox/mail.cgi

Q. I want to see what the inside of my player looks like, but I would really
   like to avoid voiding my warentee.  Is there anything you can suggest?
A. Well Björn Stenberg was kind enough to void his warentee so you don't have 
   to.  Take a look at his dissection of the player at: 
   http://bjorn.haxx.se/isd200/archos.html

Q. What exactly are you trying to achieve with this line of development?
   (A.K.A. whats your purpose for being here?)
A. Well, some of the ideas that have been presented/discussed for the future
   that we would like to see would include (in no particular order):
              - No pause between songs 
              - Mid-song resume 
              - Mid-playlist resume 
              - No-scan playlists 
              - Unlimited playlist size 
              - Autobuild playlists (ie: "all songs in this directory tree") 
              - Auto-continue play in the next directory 
              - Current folder and all sub-folder random play 
              - Full disk random play 
              - REAL random
              - Multi song queue
       	      - Faster scroll speed 
              - Archos Recorder support. Most of the hardware is the same, 
                but the display and some other things differ. 
              - More cool features with the wire remote control (including 
                controlling your Archos from your car radio (req hw mod))
              - Support playing of other files types (ie: Ogg Vorbis support)
              - Support for megabass switch (req hw mod) 
              - Player control via USB
              - Memory expansion?
   Note: Just because something is on this list, does not mean that it is
         technically feasible. (But hey we can dream)  And something not
         being on the list does not mean it isn't a neat idea.  Bring it to 
         the list.
