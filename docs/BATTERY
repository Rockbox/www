Q1: Are my batteries charged all the time when connected to my Player/Recorder?
A1: Player: the charging is all done by hardware and the exact
    functionality is hard to determine. It is however not recommended to keep
    the charger connected for more than 10-15 hours if you're not using the
    unit.

    Recorder: no. The charging algorithm is carefully crafted in to not wear
    out the batteries any more than necessary. If you're using your unit
    connected to the charger most of the time, use the 'deep discharge' option
    to save your batteries somewhat.
