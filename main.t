<p class="ingress"> Rockbox is an Open Source replacement firmware for the
Archos Jukebox 5000, 6000, Studio, Recorder, FM Recorder, Recorder V2 and
Ondio MP3 players.

<p> Rockbox is a complete rewrite and uses no fragments of the original
firmware. It boasts <a href="/twiki/bin/view/Main/FeatureComparison">numerous
features</a> while remaining <a
href="/twiki/pub/Main/RockboxManual/rockbox-manual-2.4.pdf">easy to use</a>.

<p> Installing Rockbox does not harm your Archos, it works the same way you
upgrade your ordinary Archos firmware.

<p> Development in progress might take Rockbox to <a
href="http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TargetStatus">other music
players</a>.
