<p> The Rockbox project wishes to thank all those who contributed their
 designs to the contest, for their efforts and sweat and for their support of
 the project. Unfortunately, we had to pick one single winner, even though the
 competition was fierce and many contributions were mighty fine.

<p> Thanks and gratulations of course go to Robert Hak for his design. He will
 be given two free shirts.
