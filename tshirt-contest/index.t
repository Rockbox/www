<p> <b>Prize:</b> The winning designer will be given two T-shirts, and will
get the honor of having his/hers design used on T-shirts donated to <a

<p> <b>T-Shirts:</b> <a href="http://www.haxx.se/">Haxx</a> will donate a
number of T-shirts to selected people who contribute to the project. We're
talking around 20 to 40 of them, but there is no set number yet. As donors,
Haxx will reserve the right to give away shirts to those that Haxx thinks
deserve them. We will give T-shirts to people who are skilled, comitted,
active, supportive or otherwise contributing to the project. We do <b>not</b>
focus exclusively on coders here.
