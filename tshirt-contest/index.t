 <big>Submissions are not accepted any more, the submission period is
over!</big>

<p> <b>Winner:</b> After the initial submission period, we will have a voting
period. Users will then be allowed to vote for which single design they think
is the best. The one T-shirt design with the most votes wins.

<p> <b>Prize:</b> The winning designer will be given two T-shirts, and will
get the honor of having his/hers design used on T-shirts donated to <a
href="http://rockbox.haxx.se/">Project Rockbox</a> by <a
href="http://www.haxx.se/">Haxx</a>.

<p> <b>Conditions:</b> All graphics used in the design must be your creation
or otherwise free for us to use in this purpose.

<p> <b>Dates:</b> The design submission period was open until August 31,
2002. After that, the voting period will take place and it will proceed until
Sunday September 15, 2002 with the winner announced in the following week.

<p> <b>T-Shirts:</b> <a href="http://www.haxx.se/">Haxx</a> will donate a
number of T-shirts to selected people who contribute to the project. We're
talking around 20 to 40 of them, but there is no set number yet. As donors,
Haxx will reserve the right to give away shirts to those that Haxx thinks
deserve them. We will give T-shirts to people who are skilled, comitted,
active, supportive or otherwise contributing to the project. We do <b>not</b>
focus exclusively on coders here.
